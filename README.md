## Building the web site locally

### Prerequisites

* python 3.5 or greater
* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

### Build instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-tutorials.git
cd aiida-tutorials
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install   # enable pre-commit hooks (optional)
cd docs/
make
# open build/html/index.html
```

Note that `make` will run with the nitpick option, treating warnings as errors.
If you are updating the documentation and warnings are expected, run `make html` instead.
This does not use the nitpick exception and will ensure that the documentation compiles despite the warnings.
