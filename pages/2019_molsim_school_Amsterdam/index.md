# Metal-organic frameworks for methane storage applications

In this tutorial, we will screen metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for their possible application
as methane adsorbents, allowing to store natural gas at increased density and lower storage pressure.
We will use the [AiiDA framework](www.aiida.net) in order to automate the screening workflow
and to record the full provenance of the calculations for reproducibility.

The tutorial is meant to be run inside the [Quantum Mobile](https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile) virtual machine,
using a compute resource with [zeo++](http://www.zeoplusplus.org/) and [RASPA2](https://github.com/numat/RASPA2) installed.

**Note:** This tutorial requires a basic knowledge of
[python](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/index.html). If you are not
familiar with python, we suggest you partner with someone who is.
