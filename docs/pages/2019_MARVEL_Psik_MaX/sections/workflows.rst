Workflows
=========

The aim of the last part of this tutorial is to introduce the concept of workflows in AiiDA.

In this section, we will ask you to:

1. Understand how to keep the provenance when running small python
   scripts to convert one data object into another (postprocessing,
   preparation of inputs, etc.)

2. Understand how to represent simple python functions in the AiiDA
   database

3. Learn how to write a simple workflow in AiiDA (without and with
   remote calculation submission)

4. Learn how to write a workflow with checkpoints: this means that, even
   if your workflow requires external calculations to start, they and
   their dependencies are managed through the daemon. While you are
   waiting for the calculations to complete, you can stop and even
   shutdown the computer in which AiiDA is running. When you restart,
   the workflow will continue from where it was.

5. (optional) Go a bit deeper in the syntax of workflows with
   checkpoints (``WorkChain``), e.g. implementing a convergence workflow
   using ``while`` loops.

A note: this is probably the most 'complex' part of the tutorial. We
suggest that you try to understand the underlying logic behind the
scripts, without focusing too much on the details of the workflows
implementation or the syntax. If you want, you can then focus more on
the technicalities in a second reading.

Introduction
------------

The ultimate aim of this section is to create a workflow to calculate
the equation of state of silicon. This is a very common task for an *ab
initio* researcher. An equation of state consists in calculating the
total energy (E) as a function of the unit cell volume (V). The minimal
energy is reached at the equilibrium volume. Equivalently, the
equilibrium is defined by a vanishing pressure (p=-dE/dV). In the
vicinity of the minimum, the functional form of the equation of state
can be approximated by a parabola. Such an approximation greatly
simplifies the calculation of the bulk modulus, that is proportional to
the second derivative of the energy (a more advanced
treatment requires fitting the curve with, e.g., the Birchâ€“Murnaghan
expression).

The process of calculating an equation of state puts together several
operations. First, we need to define and store in the AiiDA database the
basic structure of, e.g., bulk Si. Next, one has to define several
structures with different lattice parameters. Those structures must be
connected between them in the database, in order to ensure that their
provenance is recorded. In other words, we want to be sure that in the
future we will know that if we find a bunch of rescaled structures in
the database, they all descend from the same one. How to link two nodes
in the database in an easy way is the subject of :ref:`provenancewf`.

In the following sections, the newly created structures will then serve
as an input for total energy calculations performed, in this tutorial,
with Quantum ESPRESSO. This task is very similar to what you have done
in the previous part of the tutorial. Finally, you will fit the
resulting energies as a function of volume to get the bulk modulus. As
the EOS task is very common, we will show how to automate its
computation with workflows, and how to deal with both serial and
parallel (i.e., independent) execution of multiple tasks. Finally, we
will show how to introduce more complex logic in your workflows such as
loops and conditional statements (:ref:`see this section<convpressure>`), with an
example on a convergence loop to find iteratively the minimum of an EOS.

Process functions: a way to generalize provenance in AiiDA
----------------------------------------------------------

Imagine having a function that takes as input a string of the name of a chemical element and generates the corresponding bulk structure as a ``StructureData`` object.
The function might look like the following snippet:

.. include:: include/snippets/workflows_create_diamond_fcc.py
    :code: python

For the equation of state you need another function that takes as input a ``StructureData`` object and a rescaling factor, and returns a ``StructureData`` object with the rescaled lattice parameter:

.. include:: include/snippets/workflows_rescale.py
    :code: python

In order to generate the rescaled starting structures, say for five different lattice parameters you would combine the two functions.
Open a ``verdi shell``, define the two functions from the previous snippets and enter the following commands:

.. code:: python

    initial_structure = create_diamond_fcc('Si')
    rescaled_structures = [rescale(initial_structure, factor) for factor in (0.98, 0.99, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)]

and store them in the database:

.. code:: python

    initial_structure.store()
    for structure in rescaled_structures:
       structure.store()

As expected, all the structures that you have created are not linked in any manner as you can verify via the ``get_incoming()/get_outgoing()`` methods of the ``StuctureData`` class.
Instead, you would like these objects to be connected as sketched in :numref:`fig_provenance_process_functions`.

.. _fig_provenance_process_functions:
.. figure:: include/images/process_functions.png

   Typical graphs created by using calculation and work functions.
   (a) The calculation function ``create_structure`` takes a ``Str`` object as input and returns a single ``StructureData`` object which is used as input for the calculation function ``rescale`` together with a ``Float`` object.
   This latter calculation function returns another ``StructureData`` object, defining a crystal with a rescaled lattice constant.
   (b) Graph generated by a work function that calls two calculation functions.
   A wrapper work function ``create_rescaled`` calls serially the calculation functions ``create_structure`` and ``rescale``.
   This relationship is stored via ``CALL`` links.


Now that you are familiar with AiiDA, you know that the way to connect two data nodes is through a calculation.
In order to 'wrap' python functions and automate the generation of the needed links, in AiiDA we provide you with what we call 'process functions'.
There are two variants of process functions:

 * calculation functions
 * work functions

These operate mostly the same, but they should be used for different purposes, which will become clear later.
A normal function can be converted to a calculation function by using the ``@calcfunction`` decorator [#f1]_ that takes care of storing the execution as a calculation and adding the links between the input and output data nodes.

To turn the original functions `create_diamond_fcc` and `rescale` into calculation functions, simply change the definition as follows:

.. code:: python

    # Add this import
    from aiida.engine import calcfunction

    # Add decorators
    @calcfunction
    def create_diamond_fcc(element):
        ...

    @calcfunction
    def rescale(structure, scale):
        ...

Note that the only change is that the function definitions were 'decorated' with the ``@calcfunction`` line.
This is the only thing that is necessary to transform the plain python functions magically into fully-fledged AiiDA process functions.

.. note::

    The only additional change necessary, is that process function input and outputs need to be ``Data`` nodes, so that they can be stored in the database.
    AiiDA objects such as ``StructureData``, ``Dict``, etc. carry around information about their provenance as stored in the database.
    This is why we must use the special database-storable types ``Float``, ``Str``, etc. as shown in the snippet below.

Try now to run the following script:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.orm import Float, Str
    initial_structure = create_diamond_fcc(Str('Si'))
    rescaled_structures = [rescale(initial_structure, Float(factor)) for factor in (0.98, 0.99, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)]

and check now that the output of ``initial_structure`` as well as the input of the rescaled structures point to an intermediate node, representing the execution of the calculation function, see :numref:`fig_provenance_process_functions`.
For instance, you can check that the output links of ``initial_structure`` are the five ``rescale`` calculations:

.. code:: console

    initial_structure.get_outgoing().all_nodes()

which outputs

.. code:: console

    [<CalcFunctionNode: uuid: 9bc5e0f5-fbe4-4fad-a0d1-cf5893dac132 (pk: 437) (abc.rescale)>,
     <CalcFunctionNode: uuid: 338858ce-779b-455a-8fad-6ac71ba0d1e3 (pk: 434) (abc.rescale)>,
     <CalcFunctionNode: uuid: 0c601f8c-aa49-4957-bea1-cd796de4a323 (pk: 431) (abc.rescale)>,
     <CalcFunctionNode: uuid: bbe4fab4-6939-4f05-8bcd-5120e03ddade (pk: 428) (abc.rescale)>,
     <CalcFunctionNode: uuid: d5e68e04-8ab7-4f3a-90ff-a61f7fd4c247 (pk: 425) (abc.rescale)>]

and the inputs of each ``CalcFunctionNode`` 'rescale' are obtained with:

.. code:: python

    for structure in initial_structure.get_outgoing().all_nodes():
        print(structure.get_incoming().all_nodes())

that will return

.. code:: console

    [<StructureData: uuid: 65f50f4c-9925-4362-9c6e-f82eea83f6ce (pk: 423)>, <Float: uuid: 2adb3204-4686-4f6f-a1f5-dc2df7d4aff7 (pk: 436) value: 1.2>]
    [<StructureData: uuid: 65f50f4c-9925-4362-9c6e-f82eea83f6ce (pk: 423)>, <Float: uuid: 047406f8-c72c-4e7f-8fb2-947b81a60652 (pk: 433) value: 1.1>]
    [<StructureData: uuid: 65f50f4c-9925-4362-9c6e-f82eea83f6ce (pk: 423)>, <Float: uuid: 06c4a6d8-e1a2-4ddc-851d-0fe70860a96b (pk: 430) value: 1.0>]
    [<StructureData: uuid: 65f50f4c-9925-4362-9c6e-f82eea83f6ce (pk: 423)>, <Float: uuid: 1e1a3af3-7c76-41ff-b002-2885121cbd9e (pk: 427) value: 0.99>]
    [<StructureData: uuid: 65f50f4c-9925-4362-9c6e-f82eea83f6ce (pk: 423)>, <Float: uuid: 0f0cef0b-f1fd-4bf4-b264-78a84ebd5db8 (pk: 424) value: 0.98>]

Function nesting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calculation functions can be 'chained' together by wrapping them together in a work function.
The work function works almost exactly the same as a calculation function, except that it cannot 'create' data, but rather is used to 'call' calculation functions that do the calculations for it.
The calculation functions that it calls will be automatically linked in the provenance graph through 'call' links.
As an example, let us combine the two previously defined calculation functions by means of a wrapper work function called 'create_rescaled' that takes as input the element and the rescale factor.

Type in your shell (or modify the functions defined in ``create_rescale.py`` and then run):

.. include:: include/snippets/workflows_create_rescaled.py
    :code: python

and create an already rescaled structure by typing

.. code:: python

    rescaled = create_rescaled(element=Str('Si'), scale=Float(0.98))

Now inspect the input links of ``rescaled``:

.. code:: python

    In [6]: rescaled.get_incoming().all_nodes()
    Out[6]:
    [<WorkFunctionNode: uuid: d6afac0e-d1b3-4d66-9689-8b3347e6e315 (pk: 441) (abc.create_rescaled)>,
     <CalcFunctionNode: uuid: 83b94be8-ded5-4dcf-a929-3d57301d4dde (pk: 444) (abc.rescale)>]

The object ``rescaled`` has two incoming links, corresponding to *two* different calculations as input.
These correspond to the calculations 'create_rescaled' and 'rescale' as shown in :numref:`fig_provenance_process_functions`.
To see the 'call' link, inspect now the outputs of the ``WorkFunctionNode`` which corresponds to the ``create_rescaled`` work function.
Write down its ``<pk>`` (in general, it will be different from 441), then in the shell load the corresponding node and inspect the outputs:

.. code:: python

    In [12]: node = load_node(<pk>)
    In [13]: node.get_outgoing().all()

You should be able to identify the two children calculations as well as the final structure (you will see the process nodes linked via CALL links: these are process-to-process links representing the fact that ``create_rescaled`` called two calculation functions).
The graphical representation of what you have in the database should match :numref:`fig_provenance_process_functions`.

.. _sync:

Run a simple workflow
---------------------
Let us now use the work and calculation functions that we have just created to build a simple workflow to calculate the equation of state of silicon.
We will consider five different values of the lattice parameter obtained rescaling the experimental minimum, ``a=5.431``, by a factor in ``[0.96, 0.98, 1.0, 1.02, 1.04]``.
We will write a simple script that runs a series of five calculations and at the end returns the volume and the total energy corresponding to each value of the lattice parameter.
For your convenience, besides the functions that you have written so far in the file ``create_rescale.py``, we provide you with some other utilities to get the correct pseudopotential and to generate a pw input file, in :download:`this file <../scripts/common_wf.py>`.

We have already created the following script, which you can :download:`download <../scripts/simple_sync_workflow.py>`, but please go through the lines carefully and make sure you understand them.
We will now recreate it step by step.

Besides some AiiDA classes and functions:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.engine import run, Process, calcfunction, workfunction
    from aiida.orm import load_code
    from aiida.plugins import CalculationFactory, DataFactory

you need to import functions developed in the previous sections.
If you haven't done so already put them in the same folder where you store all your modules and then add the following imports:

.. code:: python

    from create_rescale import create_diamond_fcc, rescale
    from common_wf import generate_scf_input_params

The actual body of the script is the following.
We suggest that you first have a careful look at it before running it.

.. code:: python

    Dict = DataFactory('dict')
    Float = DataFactory('float')
    Str = DataFactory('str')

    # Load the calculation class 'PwCalculation' using its entry point 'quantumespresso.pw'
    PwCalculation = CalculationFactory('quantumespresso.pw')


    @workfunction
    def run_eos_wf(code, pseudo_family, element):
        # This will print the pk of the work function
        print('Running run_eos_wf<{}>'.format(Process.current().pid))

        scale_factors = (0.96, 0.98, 1.0, 1.02, 1.04)
        labels = ['c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4', 'c5']

        results = {}
        initial_structure = create_diamond_fcc(element)

        for label, factor in zip(labels, scale_factors):
            structure = rescale(initial_structure, Float(factor))
            inputs = generate_scf_input_params(structure, code, pseudo_family)

            print('Running a scf for {} with scale factor {}'.format(element, factor))
            result = run(PwCalculation, **inputs)
            results[label] = result['output_parameters']

        result = {
            'initial_structure': initial_structure,
            'eos': get_eos_data(**results)
        }

        return result

If you look into the previous snippets of code, you will notice that the way we submit a QE calculation is slightly different from what you have seen in the first part of the tutorial.
The following:

.. code:: python

    result = run(PwCalculation, **inputs)

runs in the current python session (without the daemon), waits for its completion and returns the output in the user-defined variable ``result``.
The latter is a dictionary whose values are the output nodes generated by the work function, with the link labels as keys.
For example once the function is finished, in order to access the total energy, we need to access the ``Dict`` node which is linked via the 'output_parameters' link (see again Fig.Â 1 of Day 1 Tutorial, to see inputs and outputs of a Quantum ESPRESSO calculation).
Once the right node is retrieved as ``result['output_parameters']``, we need to get the ``energy`` attribute.
The global operation is achieved by the command

.. code:: python

    result['output_parameters'].dict.energy

To collect these results from the various calculations into a single data node, we need one final calculation function to do so.
Since the ``run_eos_wf`` is a 'workflow'-like processes, which cannot create data, this operation **cannot** simply be done in the work function body itself.
To keep the provenance **we have to** do this through a calculation function.
This is done by the ``get_eos_data`` calculation function, that receives as inputs, the output parameters nodes from the completed calculations:

.. code:: python

    @calcfunction
    def get_eos_data(**kwargs):
        eos = [(result.dict.volume, result.dict.energy, result.dict.energy_units) for label, result in kwargs.items()]
        return Dict(dict={'eos': eos})

It constructs a new ``Dict`` node that contains a single value ``eos`` which is a list of tuples with the relevant data for each calculation.
If you were to inspect the returned data node, with for example ``verdi data dict show`` you would see something like:

.. code:: bash

    {
        "eos": [
            [
                40.04786949775,
                -308.193208771881,
                "eV"
            ],
            [
                37.6927343883263,
                -307.990673492459,
                "eV"
            ],
            [
                35.4317918679613,
                -307.666113525946,
                "eV"
            ],
            [
                45.048406674717,
                -308.308206255253,
                "eV"
            ],
            [
                42.4991194939683,
                -308.293522312459,
                "eV"
            ]
        ]
    }

As you see, the function ``run_eos_wf`` has been decorated as a work function to keep track of the provenance.
To run the workflow it suffices to call the function ``run_eos_wf`` in a python script providing the required input parameters.
For simplicity, we have included few lines at the end of the script that invoke the function with a static choice of parameters:

.. code:: python

    def run_eos(code=load_code('qe-pw-6.2.1@localhost'), pseudo_family='GBRV_lda', element='Si'):
        return run_eos_wf(code, Str(pseudo_family), Str(element))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run_eos()

To get a reference to the node that represents the function execution, we can ask the ``run`` function to, in addition to the results, also return the node.
To do so, instead of simply calling the work function to run it, use the attribute ``get_node``, like so:

.. code:: python

    results, node = run_eos_wf.get_node(Str(codename), Str(pseudo_family), Str(element))
    print('run_eos_wf<{}> completed'.format(node.pk))

Run the workflow by running the following command from the ``tutorial_scripts`` directory:

.. code:: console

    verdi run simple_sync_workflow.py

The command above locks the shell until the full workflow has completed (we will see in a moment how to avoid this).
While the function is running, you can use (in a different shell) the command ``verdi process list`` to show ongoing and finished processes.
You can 'grep' for the ``<pk>`` you are interested in.
Additionally, you can use the command ``verdi process status <pk>`` to show the tree of the calculatino functions called by the root work function with a given ``<pk>``.

Wait for the work function to finish, then call the function ``plot_eos(<pk>)`` that we provided in the file ``common_wf.py`` to plot the equation of state and fit it with a Birchâ€“Murnaghan equation.

.. _wf_multiple_calcs:

Run multiple calculations
-------------------------

You should have noticed that the calculations for different lattice
parameters are executed serially, although they might perfectly be
executed in parallel because their inputs and outputs are not connected
in any way. In the language of workflows, these calculations are
executed in a synchronous (or blocking) way, whereas we would like to
have them running *asynchronously* (i.e., in a non-blocking way, to run
them in parallel). One way to achieve this, is to submit the calculation to
the daemon using the ``submit`` function. Make a copy of the script
``simple_sync_workflow.py`` that we worked on in the previous section
and name it ``simple_submit_workflow.py``. To make the new script work
asynchronously, simply change the following subset of lines:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.engine import run
    [...]
    for label, factor in zip(labels, scale_factors):
        [...]
        results[label] = run(PwCalculation, **inputs)

    eos = get_eos_data(**{label: result['output_parameters'] for label, result in results.items()})
    [...]

replacing them with

.. code:: python

    from aiida.engine import submit
    from time import sleep
    [...]
    for label, factor in zip(labels, scale_factors):
        [...]
        results[label] = submit(PwCalculation, **inputs)
    [...]
    # Wait for the calculations to finish
    for calculation in results.values():
        while not calculation.is_finished:
            sleep(1)

    inputs = {label: node.get_outgoing().get_node_by_label('output_parameters') for label, node in results.items()}
    eos = get_eos_data(**inputs)

The main differences are:

-  ``run`` is replaced by ``submit``

-  The return value of ``submit`` is not a dictionary describing the
   outputs of the calculation, but it is the calculation node for that
   submission.

-  Each calculation starts in the background and calculation nodes are
   added to the ``results`` dictionary.

-  At the end of the loop, when all calculations have been launched with
   ``submit``, another loop is used to wait for all calculations to
   finish before gathering the results as the final step.

In the next section we will show you another way to achieve this, which
has the added bonus that it introduces checkpoints in the work function,
from which the process can be resumed should it be interrupted.

After applying the modifications, run the script. You will see that all
calculations start at the same time, without waiting for the previous
ones to finish.

If in the meantime you run ``verdi process status <pk>``, all five calculations are already shown as output.
Also, if you run ``verdi process list``, you will see how the calculations are
submitted to the scheduler.

.. _workchainsimple:

Workchains, or how not to get lost if your computer shuts down or crashes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simple workflows that we have used so far have been launched by a
python script that needs to be running for the whole time of the
execution, namely the time in which the calculations are submitted, and
the actual time needed by Quantum ESPRESSO to perform the calculation
and the time taken to retrieve the results. If you had killed the main
python process during this time, the workflow would not have terminated
correctly. Perhaps you killed the calculation and you experienced the
unpleasant consequences: intermediate calculation results are
potentially lost and it is extremely difficult to restart a workflow
from the exact place where it stopped.

In order to overcome this limitation, in AiiDA we have implemented a way
to insert checkpoints, where the main code defining a workflow can be
stopped (you can even shut down the machine on which AiiDA is running!).
We call these work functions with checkpoints 'work chains' because, as
you will see, they basically amount to splitting a work function in a
chain of steps. Each step is then ran by the daemon, in a way similar to
the remote calculations.

Here below you can find the basic rules that allow you to convert your
workfunction-based script to a workchain-based one and a snippet example
focusing on the code used to perform the calculation of an equation of state.

.. code:: console

    from aiida.engine import WorkChain, ToContext
    # ...

    class EquationOfStates(WorkChain):

        @classmethod
        def define(cls, spec):
            super(EquationOfStates, cls).define(spec)
            spec.input('element', valid_type=Str)
            spec.input('code', valid_type=Str)
            spec.input('pseudo_family', valid_type=Str)
            spec.outline(
                cls.run_pw,
                cls.return_results,
            )


        def run_pw(self):
            # ...
            self.ctx.s0 = create_diamond_fcc(Str(self.inputs.element))


            calcs = {}
            for label, factor in zip(labels, scale_facs):
                s = rescale(self.ctx.s0, Float(factor))
                inputs = generate_scf_input_params(
                    s, str(self.inputs.code), self.inputs.pseudo_family)
                # ...
                future = self.submit(PwCalculation, **inputs)
                calcs[label] = future

            # Ask the workflow to continue when the results are ready and store them in the context
            return ToContext(**calcs)

        def return_results(self):
            eos = []
            for label in labels:
                eos.append(get_info({entry.link_label: entry.node for entry in self.ctx[label].get_outgoing().all()}))

            # Return information to plot the EOS
            Dict = DataFactory('dict')
            retdict = {
                'initial_structure': self.ctx.s0,
                'result': Dict(dict={'eos_data': eos})
            }
            for link_name, node in retdict.iteritems():
                self.out(link_name, node)

-  Instead of using decorated functions you need to define a class,
   inheriting from a prototype class called ``WorkChain`` that is
   provided by AiiDA

-  Within your class you need to implement a ``define`` classmethod that
   always takes ``cls`` and ``spec`` as inputs. Here you
   specify the main information on the workchain, in particular:

   -  the *inputs* that the workchain expects. This is obtained by means
      of the ``spec.input()`` method, which provides as the key feature the automatic
      validation of the input types via the ``valid_type`` argument.
      The same holds true for outputs, as you can use the
      ``spec.output()`` method to state what output types are expected
      to be returned by the workchain.

   -  the ``outline`` consisting in a list of 'steps' that you want to
      run, put in the right sequence. This is obtained by
      means of the method ``spec.outline()`` which takes as input the
      steps. *Note*: in this example we just split the main execution in
      two sequential steps, that is, first ``run_pw`` then
      ``return_results``. However, more complex logic is allowed, as
      will be explained in :ref:`another section<convpressure>`.

-  You need to split your main code into methods, with the names you
   specified before into the outline (``run_pw`` and ``return_results``
   in this example). Where exactly should you split the
   code? Well, the splitting points should be put where you would
   normally block the execution of the script for collecting results in
   a standard work function, namely whenever you call the method
   ``.result()``. Each method should accept only one parameter,
   ``self``, e.g. ``def step_name(self)``.

-  You will notice that the methods reference the attribute ``ctx``
   through ``self.ctx``, which is called the *context* and is inherited
   from the base class ``WorkChain``. A python function or work function
   normally just stores variables in the local scope of the function.
   For instance, in the example of :ref:`this subsection<sync>`, you stored
   the ``calc_results`` in the ``eos`` list, that was a local variable.
   In work chains, instead, to preserve variables between different
   steps, you need to store them in a special dictionary called
   *context*. As explained above, the context variable ``ctx`` is
   inherited from the base class ``WorkChain``, and at each step method
   you just need to update its content. AiiDA will take care of saving
   the context somewhere between workflow steps (on disk, in the
   database, depending on how AiiDA was configured). For your
   convenience, you can also access the value of a context variable as
   ``self.ctx.varname`` instead of ``self.ctx['varname']``.

-  Any submission within the workflow should not call the normal ``run``
   or ``submit`` functions, but ``self.submit`` to which you have to
   pass the process class, and a dictionary of inputs.

-  The submission in ``run_pw`` returns a future and not the actual
   calculation, because at that point in time we have only just launched
   the calculation to the daemon and it is not yet completed. Therefore
   it literally is a 'future' result. Yet we still need to add these
   futures to the context, so that in the next step of the workchain,
   when the calculations are in fact completed, we can access them and
   continue the work. To do this, we can use the ``ToContext`` class.
   This class takes a dictionary, where the values are the futures and
   the keys will be the names under which the corresponding calculations
   will be made available in the context when they are done. See how the
   ``ToContext`` object is created and returned in ``run_pw``.
   By doing this, the workchain will implicitly wait for the results of
   all the futures you have specified, and then call the next step *only
   when all futures have completed*.

-  *Return values*: While in a normal work function you attach output
   nodes to the ``WorkFunctionNode`` by invoking the *return*
   statement, in a workchain you need to call
   ``self.out(link_name, node)`` for each node you want to return.
   Of course, if you have already prepared a dictionary of
   outputs, you can just use the following syntax:

   .. code:: python

       self.out_many(retdict)  # Keys are link names, value the nodes

   The advantage of this different syntax is that you can start emitting
   output nodes already in the middle of the execution, and not
   necessarily at the very end as it happens for normal functions
   (*return* is always the last instruction executed in a function or method).
   Also, note that once you have called ``self.out(link_name, node)`` on
   a given ``link_name``, you can no longer call ``self.out()`` on the
   same ``link_name``: this will raise an exception.

Finally, the workflow has to be run. For this you have to use the
function ``run`` passing as arguments the ``EquationOfStates`` class and
the inputs as key-value arguments. For example, you can execute

.. code:: python

     run(EquationOfStates, element=Str('Si'), code=Str('qe-pw-6.2.1@localhost'),
         pseudo_family=Str('GBRV_lda'))

While the workflow is running, you can check (in a different terminal)
what is happening to the calculations using ``verdi process list``.
You will see that after a few seconds the calculations are all submitted
to the scheduler and can potentially run at the same time.

**Note:** You will see warnings that say
``Exception trying to save checkpoint, this means you will not be able to restart in case of a crash until the next successful checkpoint``,
these are generated by the ``PwCalculation`` which is unable to save a
checkpoint because it is not in a so called 'importable path'. Simply
put, this means that if AiiDA were to try and reload the class it
wouldn't know which file to find it in. To get around this you could
simply put the workchain in a different file that is in the 'PYTHONPATH'
and then launch it by importing it in your launch file. In this way AiiDA
knows where to find it next time it loads the checkpoint.

As an additional exercise (optional), instead of running the main
workflow (``EquationOfStates``), try to submit it. Note that the file
where the work chains is defined will need to be globally importable (so
the daemon knows how to load it) and you need to launch it (with
``submit``) from a different python file. The easiest way to achieve
this is typically to embed the workflow inside a python package.

**Note:** As good practice, you should try to keep the steps as short as
possible in term of execution time. The reason is that the daemon can be
stopped and restarted only between execution steps and not if a step is
in the middle of a long execution.

Finally, as an optional exercise if you have time, you can jump to
:ref:`this appendix<convpressure>`, which shows how to introduce more complex
logic into your work chains (if conditionals, while loops etc.). The
exercise will show how to realize a convergence loop to obtain the
minimum-volume structure in a EOS using the Newton's algorithm.

.. [#f1] In simple words, a decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function. In python, a function can be decorated by adding a line of the form ``@decorating_function_name`` on the line just before the ``def`` line of the decorated function. If you want to know more, there are many online resources explaining python decorators.
