Queries in AiiDA - Examples and Exercises
=========================================

Optional exercises on relationships (Task 3)
--------------------------------------------

**Hint for the exercises:**

-  You can have projections on properties of more than one entity in
   your query. You just have to add the ``project`` key (specifying the
   list of properties that you want to project) along with the
   corresponding entity when you append it.

**Exercises:**   Try to write the following queries:

-  Find all descendants of a ``StructureData`` with a certain ``uuid``
   (descendants indicate all nodes that can be reached by following
   outgoing links starting from a given node, with any number of hops).
   For every match, print both the ``StructureData`` node and the
   descendant.

-  Find all the ``FolderData`` nodes created by a specific user.

Optional exercises on attributes and extras (Task 4)
----------------------------------------------------

**Hint for the exercises:**

-  You can easily order or limit the number of the results by using the
   ``order_by()`` and ``limit()`` methods of the QueryBuilder. For
   example, we can order all our ``CalcJobNode``\ s by their ``id`` and
   limit the result to the first 10 as follows:

   .. code:: python

       qb = QueryBuilder()
       qb.append(CalcJobNode, tag='calc')
       qb.order_by({'calc': 'id'})
       qb.limit(10)
       qb.all()

**Exercises:**

-  Write a code snippet to check how many pseudopotentials you have for
   each element.

-  Smearing contribution to the total energy for calculations:

   1. Write a query that returns the smearing contribution to the energy
      stored in some instances of ``Dict`` output by a ``CalcJobNode``
      generated by running a ``PwCalculation`` process.

   2. Extend the previous query to also get the input structures of the
      ``CalcJobNode``.

   3. Which structures have a smearing contribution to the energy
      smaller or equal to -0.02?

Summarizing what we learned by now - An example
-----------------------------------------------

At this point you should be able to do queries with projections, joins
and filters. Moreover, you saw how to apply filters and projections even
on attributes and extras. Let’s discover the full power of the
QueryBuilder with a complex graph query that allows you to project
various properties from different nodes and apply different filters and
joins.

Imagine that you would like to get the smearing energy for all the
calculations that have a smearing energy below a given value and have a

.. math:: \mathrm{Sn_{2}O_{3}}

as input. Moreover, besides the smearing energy, you would like to print
the units of this energy and the formula of the structure that was given
to the calculation. The graphical representation of this query can be
seen in Figure [fig:qb2] and the actual query follows:

   Complex graph query.

.. code:: python

    qb = QueryBuilder()
    qb.append(
            StructureData,
            project=["extras.formula"],
            filters={"extras.formula": "Sn2O3"},
            tag="structure"
        )
    qb.append(
            Calculation,
            tag="calculation",
            with_incoming="structure"
        )
    qb.append(
            Dict,
            tag="results",
            filters={"attributes.energy_smearing":{"<=":-0.0001}},
            project=[
                "attributes.energy_smearing",
                "attributes.energy_smearing_units",
            ],
            with_incoming="calculation"
    )
    qb.all()
