A real-world ``WorkChain``: Computing a band structure
======================================================

.. note:: *If you still have enough time, you might want to first check*
          :numref:`Appendix %s <workflow_logic>` *before continuing with this section.*

As a final demonstration of the power of ``WorkChain``\ s in AiiDA, we want to
give a demonstration of a ``WorkChain``, which will take a structure as its
only input and compute its band structure. All of the steps that would
normally have to be done manually by the researcher -- choosing appropriate
pseudopotentials, energy cutoffs, k-point meshes, high-symmetry k-point paths,
and performing the various calculation steps -- are performed automatically by
the ``WorkChain``.

The demonstration of the WorkChain will be performed in a Jupyter notebook,
that you can :download:`download from here <../notebooks/bandstructure.ipynb>`.
There you will find some example structures that are loaded from the
Crystallography Open Database (COD), using the COD-importer integrated in
AiiDA.

Note that the required time to calculate the bandstructure for the given
structures ranges from ~5 minutes to more than an hour, given that the virtual
machine is running on two cores with CPU throttling. It is not necessary to
run all these examples as they may take too long to complete. For reference,
the expected output band structures are plotted in :numref:`fig_calc_bands_1`
to :numref:`fig_calc_bands_4`.
