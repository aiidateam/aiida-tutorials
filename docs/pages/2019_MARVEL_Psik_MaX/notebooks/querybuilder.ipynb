So in order to find a needle that we might be looking for in this big haystack, we need an efficient excavation and search tool. The tool that `AiiDA` provides to do exactly this is called the `QueryBuilder`. The `QueryBuilder` acts as the gatekeeper to your database, that you can ask questions about the contents of your database (also referred to as queries), by specifying what it is that you are looking for. In this part of the tutorial, we will focus on how to use the `QueryBuilder` to make these queries and understand/use the results.\n",

    "In section 2, we showed you how you can `project` specific properties of a `Node` and gave a list of properties that a `Node` instance possesses. Since then, we have come across a lot of different `AiiDA` data nodes, such as `StructureData` and `UpfData`, that were secretly `Node`'s in disguise. Or to put it correctly, as `AiiDA` employs the object-oriented programming paradigm, both `StructureData` and `UpfData` are examples of subclasses of the `Node` class and therefore inherit its properties. That means that whatever property a `Node` has, both `StructureData` and `UpfData` will have too. However, there is a semantic difference between a `StructureData` node and a `UpfData`, and so we may want to add a property to one that would not make sense for the other. To solve this, `AiiDA` introduces the concept of `attributes`. These are similar to properties, except that they are specific to the `Node` type that they are attached to. This allows you to add an `attribute` to a certain node, without having to change the implementation of all the others.\n",
