    "### Calculating the electronic band structure with an AiiDA workchain\n",
    "This tutorial will show how useful a workchain can be in performing a well defined task, such as computing and visualizing the electronic band structure for a simple crystal structure. The goal of this tutorial is not to show you the intricacies of the actual workchain itself, but rather to serve as an example that workchains can simplify standard workflows in computational materials science. The workchain that we will use here will employ Quantum Espresso's pw.x code to calculate the charge densities for several crystal structures and compute a band structure from those. Many choices that normally face the researcher before being able to perform this calculation, such as the selection of suitable pseudo potentials, energy cutoff values, k-point grids and k-point paths along high symmetry points, are now performed automatically by the workchain. All that remains for the user to do is to simply define a structure, pass it to the workchain and sit back!"
