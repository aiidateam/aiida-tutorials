Since then, we have come across a lot of different `AiiDA` data nodes, such as `StructureData` and `UpfData`, that were secretly `Node`'s in disguise. Or to put it correctly, as `AiiDA` employs the object-oriented programming paradigm, both `StructureData` and `UpfData` are examples of subclasses of the `Node` class and therefore inherit its properties. That means that whatever property a `Node` has, both `StructureData` and `UpfData` will have too. However, there is a semantic difference between a `StructureData` node and a `UpfData`, and so we may want to add a property to one that would not make sense for the other. To solve this, `AiiDA` introduces the concept of `attributes`. These are similar to properties, except that they are specific to the `Node` type that they are attached to. This allows you to add an `attribute` to a certain node, without having to change the implementation of all the others.\n", "\n", "For example, the `Dict` nodes that are generated as output of `PwCalculation`'s may have an attribute named `wfc_cutoff`.
