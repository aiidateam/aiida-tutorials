Getting set up
===============

Download and install the [Quantum Mobile virtual machine](https://github.com/marvel-nccr/quantum-mobile/releases/tag/18.06.0),
which comes both with AiiDA already preconfigured and with a number of useful
codes and tools for computational materials science.

Start the virtual machine, open a terminal window and
type

```console
$ workon aiida
```

This activates the virtual environment, in which AiiDA is installed.

Since Quantum Mobile focuses on *ab initio* calculations, it is missing
some aiida plugins we are going to need. Letâ€™s install them (this can
take 3 minutes):

```console
$ pip install aiidalab==19.01.2
```

> **Note**
> You may encounter warnings about version conflicts.
> As long as the command finishes with `Successfully installed ...` don't worry and proceed.
>
> **Note**
> To make sure that AiiDA noticed all the plugin updates please run
>
> ```console
> $ reentry scan
> ```

Furthermore, you are currently using the `default` AiiDA profile.

```console
$ verdi profile list
```

At the end of the tutorial, we'll ask you to submit the data you computed,
so let's create a new profile in order to associate this data with you:

```console
$ verdi quicksetup
Profile name [quicksetup]: molsim2019
Email Address (identifies your data when sharing): leopold.talirz@epfl.ch
First Name: Leopold
Last Name: Talirz
Institution: EPFL

Setup finished.
The default profile for the 'verdi' process is set to 'default': do you want to set the newly created 'molsim2019' as the new default? (can be reverted later) [y/N]: y
The default profile for the 'daemon' process is set to 'default': do you want to set the newly created 'molsim2019' as the new default? (can be reverted later) [y/N]: y
```

Use `verdi profile list` to verify that you've switched to your new personal AiiDA profile.
