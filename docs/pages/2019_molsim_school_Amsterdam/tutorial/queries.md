# Querying the AiiDA database {#sec:querybuilder}

We will now learn how to *query* the AiiDA database using the python interface.
Queries are, in essence, questions to your database and you will use the
answers you obtain in order to identify good candidate materials for methane
storage.

## The AiiDA QueryBuilder

AiiDA provides a querying tool called the [QueryBuilder](http://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/querying/querybuilder/usage.html).
When working in the `verdi shell` or a jupyter notebook with `%aiida` enabled,
the `QueryBuilder` class has already been imported.

Let's create a new querybuilder for our query:

```python
qb = QueryBuilder()
```

Now we need to say which nodes of the AiiDA graph we are interested in.
All node types of the AiiDA graph derive from the `Node` class, so in order to select the most
generic type of node, simply append `Node`:

```python
qb.append(Node)
```

At this point, we can finish our query by asking for all nodes matching these criteria:

```python
qb.all() # Returns all nodes in the database
```

> **Note**
> We could also have used `qb.first()` to get the first node.
> Always use tab-completion when in doubt which functions can be used on a python object.

This command will return us all the Nodes directly, which may
not be the most wise thing to do considering that is the biggest family
of AiiDA stored objects that we can query.
To understand the size of the result, we can type the following command:

```python
qb.count() # Returns an integer, the number of nodes in the database
```

If you are interested to retrieve a subclass of a node, append that
specific subclass instead of Node:

```python
CifData = DataFactory('cif')
qb = QueryBuilder() # Creating a new QueryBuilder instance
qb.append(CifData) # Telling the QueryBuilder instance that I want a cif data type
qb.all() # Asking for all the results!
```

> **Note**
> Remember to create a new `qb = QueryBuilder()` instance for each new query.

Other data types we will need in the tutorial are:

```python
ParameterData = DataFactory('parameter')
NetworkCalculation = CalculationFactory('zeopp.network')
RaspaCalculation = CalculationFactory('raspa')
```

---
### Exercise

Find the number of `CifData` and `NetworkCalculation` nodes in the database.
Is there one calculation for every structure?

You may also be interested to learn [where the structures are coming from](../theoretical/502-mofs).

| Node & subclasses |  Number in DB
|-------------------| --------------
|       Node        |      2519
|   StructureData   |       0
|      CifData      |      503
|   ParameterData   |      503
|  SinglefileData   |       1
|       Code        |       1
|  JobCalculation   |      503

*List of some Node subclasses and how many times they occur in our test database.*

> **Note**
> Advanced users who are familiar with SQL
> (Structured Query Language) syntax, can inspect the generated SQL query via:
> ```python
> str(qb)

## Projections

So far, we've retrieved node objects but we are interested in the information they contain.
In database language, performing a projection means to extract one or
more specific columns from a table. In AiiDA language it means to
specify which properties of the selected nodes our query should return.

|---------| -------------------------|
|Entity   | Properties               |
|---------| -------------------------|
|Node     | id, uuid, type, label, description, ctime, mtime|
|Computer | id, uuid, name, hostname, description, enabled, transport_type, scheduler_type|
|User     | id, email, first_name, last_name, institution|
|Group    | id, uuid, name, type, time, description|
|---------| -------------------------|

### A selection of entities and some of their properties

For example, we might be interested only in type and universally unique
identifier (UUID) of each node:

```python
qb = QueryBuilder()
qb.append(Node, project=["type", "uuid"])
qb.all()
```

> **Note**
> Please use the `id` keyword in QueryBuilder queries to access the PK of a node.

## Filters

We already know how to filter by the type of node,
but often we would like to filter the results by other node properties.

For example, we might want to select all
the calculations that were launched on a specific date. In database
language, this is called "adding a filter" to a query. A filter is a
boolean operator that returns `True` or `False`.

|  Operator   |         Datatype         |               Example
|-------------| -------------------------| ------------------------------------
|     ==      |            All           |              `{'==':12}`
|     in      |            All           |    `{'in':['FINISHED', 'PARSING']}`
| >,<,<=,>=   |  floats, integers, dates |             `{'>':5.2}`
|    like     |           Chars          |       `{'like':'calculation%'}`
|    ilike    |           Chars          |       `{'ilike':'caLculAtioN%'}`
|     or      |                          |  `{'or':[{'<':5.3}, {'>':6.3}]}`
|     and     |                          |  `{'and':[{'>':5.3}, {'<':6.3}]}`

### Selection of filter operators

If you want to add filters to your query, use the `filters`
and provide a dictionary with the filters you would like to apply.
Let's filter out the structure with label "HKUST1":

```python
qb = QueryBuilder()  # Instantiating a new QueryBuilder
qb.append(CifData,   # I want structures
  project=["id"],    # I want to know the id
  filters={"label": {"==":"HKUST1"}})  # Only structures with this label
qb.all()
```
