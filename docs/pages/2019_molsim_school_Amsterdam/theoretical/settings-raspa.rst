Settings for RASPA
==================

The RASPA package can perform MC and MD calculations, for a variety of
systems.

In this tutorial we use this program to perform Grand Canonical (GCMC)
calculations in nanoporous structures. Here it is basic input:

These settings are imported in AiiDA as a ParameterData object, with the
"shape" of a python dictionary.

You should fill the input settings, replacing asterisks with meaningful
values.

Consider that the forcefield parameters that you will be using to model
the framework-molecule interactions are on your remote computer:

-  ``$RASPA_DIR/share/raspa/forcefield/UFF-TraPPE/`` contains the
   Lennard-Jones parameters for the framework atoms, from
   `UFF <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00051a040>`__, and for
   methane, from
   `TraPPE <http://chem-siepmann.oit.umn.edu/siepmann/trappe/index.html>`__
-  ``$RASPA_DIR/share/raspa/molecules/TraPPE/`` contains the file
   ``methane.def`` with the critical T and P and acentric factor of
   methane (why?) and the geometry of this gas molecule. Note that we
   are using a forcefield where methane is modelled as a single point!

As an extra exercise you may decide to use another popular forcefield
for the framework atoms:
`DREIDING <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100389a010>`__. Note
that, since it does not contain all the atoms of the periodic table, it
is common practice to use UFF parameters for the missing ones.\\ You can
find this forcefield as
``$RASPA_DIR/share/raspa/forcefield/DREIDING-TraPPE/``, and remember to
modify ``Forcefield DREIDING-TraPPE`` in the input.

You can even modify, create or import your own forcefield: just create
the folder ``$RASPA_DIR/share/raspa/forcefield/{ffname}/``, copy the
file formatting of the other forcefield .def files and specify
``Forcefield {ffname}`` in the input.

A few hints for the settings:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``BlockPockets`` and ``BlockPocketsFileName`` will be filled by
   AiiDA: if Zeo++ finds some non accessible pore volume, it can
   generate a .block file with the positions and the radii of blocking
   spheres. These spheres are inserted in the framework to prevent Raspa
   from inserting molecules in the non accessible pore.

-  You need to choose ``NumberOfInitializationCycles`` and
   ``NumberOfCycles``. Consider that for every cycle every molecule of
   your system is selected to perform a MC movement that may be accepted
   or rejected. If your system is empty or there are a few particles,
   Raspa tries to perform GCMC insertions ("swaps") to fill your system
   (see UMS, Algorithm 13). The number of particles continues to
   fluctuate according to the Grand Canonical ensemble, and consider
   that after ``NumberOfInitializationCycles`` cycles, Raspa start to
   compute the average number of particles for ``NumberOfCycles``
   cycles. Therefore, the number of cycles should be large enough to
   compute statistics correctly but not too large to waist computational
   times after your uncertainty is already low. Standard deviation is
   computed using Block Averages (see UMS pag. 529).

   Here an example of the value fluctuation and average, with the averaging starting after 10k cycles.

-  You have to chose the probability for the different swap movements.
   The total will be normalized: for example if you assign 2.0, 1.0,
   1.0, 1.0, this will be normalized as 40%, 20%, 20%, 20% probability
   for each move.

   -  ``TranslationProbability``: rigid displacement by a random
      distance. The maximum displacement is scaled during the simulation
      to achieve an acceptance ratio of 50%.
   -  ``RotationProbability``: rotation around its starting bead
   -  ``ReinsertionProbability``: reinsertion of the particle in a
      random position of the unit cell.
   -  ``SwapProbability``: insertion or deletion move. Whether to insert
      or delete is decided randomly with a probability of 50% for each.
      The swap move imposes a chemical equilibrium between the system
      and an imaginary particle reservoir for the current component.

-  Choose a reasonable ``cutoff`` (Angstrom) to exclude negligible
   Lennard-Jones interaction between far particles. Consider that the
   higher the cutoff the more you will have to expand your structures!

-  You can choose ``ChargeMethod`` to ``None`` or ``Ewald``, depending
   if you want or not to compute Coulombic interactions.

-  ``FrameworkName`` will be filled by AiiDA

-  ``UnitCells`` will be filled by the multiply\_unit\_cell(cif)
   function: it gives the cell expansion that you need to perform
   according to the cutoff you chose.

-  With ``CreateNumberOfMolecules`` you can specify the number of
   particles that will be inserted (randomly) in your system at the
   start of your simulation.
