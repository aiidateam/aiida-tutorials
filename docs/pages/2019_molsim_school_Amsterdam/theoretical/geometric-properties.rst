Geometric properties
====================

There are several metrics we want you to use to pre-evaluate the
performance of a material for methane storage.

We used `Zeo++ <http://www.zeoplusplus.org/>`__ to compute this
properties.

-  *largest included sphere (Di)*, the largest sphere that can fit the
   largest pore of the structure

-  *largest free sphere (Df)*, the largest spherical probe that can
   percolate through the material

-  *largest included sphere along the free sphere path (Dif)*, the
   largest sphere that can fit along the channel where the largest free
   sphere was evaluated. Therefore Di = Dif if there is only one channel
   or if the largest pore is along the largest channel.

-  *internal surface area*, considering the atoms of the frameworks as
   spheres, and rolling a spherical probe on their surface. By
   convention the probe has a radius of 1.86 Angstrom, half the kinetic
   diameter of the nitrogen molecule. This is a purely geometrical
   quantity and may differ a lot with the measured BET surface
   `(Rouquerol2007) <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167299107800085>`__.

-  *geometric pore volume*, considering the atoms of the frameworks as
   spheres, all the volume outside the spheres.

-  *probe-occupiable pore volume* (or Connolly volume ), considering the
   atoms of the frameworks as spheres, all the pore volume where a
   spherical probe could fit. The pore volume can also be distinguished
   into accessible or not-accessible, if the probe can actually diffuse
   or not inside that space: in the second case you are expected to use
   blocking spheres to avoid the insertion of gas molecule in Monte
   Carlo algorithms.

-  *void fraction*, fraction of pore volume over the total volume of the
   unit cell. If you wonder why sometimes it is called "helium void
   fraction", it was a convention to use the helium atom as probe to
   compute (BC: NOT measure experimentally!) this quantity. However,
   using helium to compute the void fraction is not very physically
   meaningful
   `(Ongari2017) <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b01682>`__.

-  *number of channels*, the number of unconnected channels of the
   porous material where the probe can diffuse through

It is very interesting to compare these metrics to the performance of
your materials for a certain application, to be able to find any
correlation that could help to discover the best framework for that
application. See for example
`Wilmer2012 <http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c2ee23201d>`__.
