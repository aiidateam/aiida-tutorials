Multiplying the unit cell
=========================

You learned that the lengths of your simulation box should bigger than
twice the cutoff value.\\ Therefore, for an orthogonal cell you should
multiply you cell until its length meets this criterion in every
direction.

But what if the cell is not orthogonal?

You should not speak in terms of "lengths" but in terms of
"perpendicular lengths", as shown in the figure for the two-dimensional
case. While in the orthogonal case one can simplify pwa = b and pwb = a,
in a tilted unit cell we have to compute pwa and pwb and then evaluate
if the cell needs to be expanded, and the multiplication coefficients.

This explains why we need so much math in the function
``multiply_unit_cell(cif)``, to compute the Raspa input "UnitCells".

Note that if you do not multiply correctly the unit cell, Raspa will
complain in the output:

.. code:: console

    WARNING: INAPPROPRIATE NUMBER OF UNIT CELLS USED

and you will (usually) get an uptake that is less then the correct one.
Why?
