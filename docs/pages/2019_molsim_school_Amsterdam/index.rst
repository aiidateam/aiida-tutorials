This tutorial is part of the `Understanding molecular
simulation <http://www.acmm.nl/molsim/molsim2019/>`__ school held at the
University of Amsterdam from January 7-18 2019.


Metal-organic frameworks for methane storage applications
=========================================================

In this tutorial, we will screen metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for
their possible application as methane adsorbents, allowing to store
natural gas at increased density and lower storage pressure. We will use
the `AiiDA framework <www.aiida.net>`__ in order to automate the
screening workflow and to record the full provenance of the calculations
for reproducibility.

The tutorial is meant to be run inside the `Quantum
Mobile <https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile>`__ virtual
machine, using a compute resource with
`zeo++ <http://www.zeoplusplus.org/>`__ and
`RASPA2 <https://github.com/numat/RASPA2>`__ installed.

.. note::

   This tutorial requires a basic knowledge of
   `python <https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/index.html>`__. If you are
   not familiar with python, we suggest you partner with someone who is.
