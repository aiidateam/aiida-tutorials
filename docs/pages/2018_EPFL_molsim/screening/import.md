Import the structures
=====================

You can download a tar file containing the structures from

```console
$ wget {{ "/assets/2018_EPFL_molsim/mof_structures.tar.gz" | absolute_url }}
$ tar -xf mof_structures.tar.gz
```

- Visualize a few structures using `jmol`:

  ```console
  $ cd struct/
  $ jmol <structure>.cif
  ```

  Can you think of two criteria for a high deliverable methane
  capacity?

- Use the `CifData` class to import the structures into your database, e.g.

  ```python
  CifData = DataFactory('cif')
  cif = CifData(file='/path/to/file.cif')
  cif.store()
  ```

- Use wildcards with the `glob` and `os` modules to get the file paths
  of all structures like so:

  ```python
  from glob import glob
  from os import path
  all_structure_files = glob(path.abspath("/path/to/struct/*"))
  ```

- Keep track of your structures using groups

  ```python
  # Use get_or_create to be able to run this multiple times mofs,
  created = Group.get_or_create(name='mofs')
  mofs.add_nodes([cif1, cif2])
  ```

- Finally, you can load your structures from the group using the
  [AiiDA query builder](http://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/querying/querybuilder/usage.html)

  ```python
  qb = QueryBuilder()
  qb.append(Group, filters = { 'name':'mofs' })
  mofs = qb.one()[0]

  for cif in mofs.nodes:
      print cif
  ```
