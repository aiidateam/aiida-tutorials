# Verdi shell and AiiDA objects

In this section we will use an interactive ipython environment with all the basic AiiDA classes already loaded. We propose two realizations of such a tool. The first consist of a special ipython shell where all the AiiDA classes, methods and functions are accessible. Type in the terminal

```console
 verdi shell
```

For all the everyday AiiDA-based operations, i.e. creating, querying and using AiiDA objects, the `verdi shell` is probably the best tool. In this case, we suggest that you use two terminals, one for the `verdi shell` and one to execute bash commands.

The second option is based on `jupyter` notebooks and is probably most suitable to the purposes of our tutorial. Go to the browser where you have opened `jupyter` and click `New` \(\to\) `Python 2` (top right corner). This will open an ipython notebook based on cells where you can type portions of python code. The code will not be executed until you press `Shift+Enter` from within a cell. Type in the first cell

``` python
 %aiida
```

and execute it. This will set exactly the same environment as the `verdi shell`. The notebook will be automatically saved upon any modification and when you think you are done, you can export your notebook in many formats by going to `File` \(\to\) `Download as`. We suggest you to have a look to the drop-down menus `Insert` and `Cell` where you will find the main commands to manage the cells of your notebook. **The `verdi shell` and the `jupyter` notebook are completely equivalent. Use either according to your personal preference.**

Note: you will still need sometimes to type command-line instructions in `bash` in the first terminal you opened today. To differentiate these from the commands to be typed in the `verdi shell`, the latter will be marked in this document by a vertical line on the left, like:

``` python
 some verdi shell command
```

while command-line instructions in `bash` to be typed on a terminal will be encapsulated between horizontal lines:

```console
 some bash command
```

Alternatively, to avoid changing terminal, you can execute `bash` commands within the `verdi shell` or the notebook adding an exclamation mark before the command itself

``` python
 !some bash command
```

## Loading a node

Most AiiDA objects are represented by nodes, identified in the database by its pk number (an integer). You can access a node using the following command in the shell:

``` python
 node = load_node(PK)
```

Load a node using one of the calculation pks visible in the graph you displayed in the previous section of the tutorial. Then get the energy of the calculation with the command

``` python
 node.res.energy
```

You can also type

``` python
 node.res.
```

and then press `TAB` to see all the possible output results of the calculation.

## Loading different kinds of nodes

### Pseudopotentials

From the graph displayed in Section [sec:aiida_graph], find the pk of the barium pseudopotential file (LDA). Load it and verify that it describes barium. Type

``` python
 upf = load_node(PK)
 upf.element
```

All methods of `UpfData` are accessible by typing `upf.` and then pressing `TAB`.

### k-points

A set of k-points in the Brillouin zone is represented by an instance of the `KpointsData` class. Choose one from the graph of Section [sec:aiida_graph], load it as `kpoints` and inspect its content:

``` python
 kpoints.get_kpoints_mesh()
```

Then get the full (explicit) list of k-points belonging to this mesh using

``` python
 kpoints.get_kpoints_mesh(print_list=True)
```

If you incurred in a `AttributeError`, it means that the kpoints instance does not represent a regular mesh but rather a list of k-points defined by their crystal coordinates (typically used when plotting a band structure). In this case, get the list of k-points coordinates using

``` python
 kpoints.get_kpoints()
```

If you prefer Cartesian (rather than crystal) coordinates, type

``` python
 kpoints.get_kpoints(cartesian=True)
```

For later use in this tutorial, let us try now to create a kpoints instance, to describe a regular \(2\times2\times2\) mesh of k-points, centered at the Gamma point (i.e. without offset). This can be done with the following commands:

``` python
 from aiida.orm.data.array.kpoints import KpointsData
 kpoints = KpointsData()
 kpoints_mesh = 2
 kpoints.set_kpoints_mesh([kpoints_mesh,kpoints_mesh,kpoints_mesh])
 kpoints.store()
```

The import performed in the first line is however unpractical as it requires to remember the exact location of the module containing the KpointsData class. Instead, it is easier to use the `DataFactory` function instead of an explicit import.

``` python
 KpointsData = DataFactory("array.kpoints")
```

This function loads the appropriate class defined in a string (here `array.kpoints`).[1] Therefore, `KpointsData` is not a class instance, but the kpoints class itself!

### Parameters

Nested dictionaries with individual parameters, as well as lists and arrays, are represented in AiiDA with `ParameterData` objects. Get the PK and load the input parameters of a calculation in the graph of Section [sec:aiida_graph]. Then display its content by typing

``` python
 params.get_dict()
```

where `params` is the `ParameterData` node you loaded. Modify the dictionary content so that the wave-function cutoff is now set to 20 Ry. Note that you cannot modify an object already stored in the database. To save the modification, you must create a new ParameterData object. Similarly to what discussed before, first load the `ParameterData` class by typing

``` python
 ParameterData = DataFactory('parameter')
```

Then an instance of the class (i.e. the parameter object that we want to create) is created and initialized by the command

``` python
 new_params = ParameterData(dict=YOUR_DICT)
```

where `YOUR_DICT` is the modified dictionary. Note that the parameter object is not yet stored in the database. In fact, if you simply type `new_params` in the verdi shell, you will be prompted with a string notifying you the “unstored” status. To save an entry in the database corresponding to the `new_params` object, you need to type a last command in the verdi shell:

``` python
 new_params.store()
```

### Structures

Find a structure in the graph of Section [sec:aiida_graph] and load it. Display its chemical formula, atomic positions and species using

``` python
 structure.get_formula()
 structure.sites
```

where `structure` is the structure you loaded. If you are familiar with ASE and PYMATGEN, you can convert this structure to those formats by typing

``` python
 structure.get_ase()
 structure.get_pymatgen()
```

Let’s try now to define a new structure to study, specifically a silicon crystal. In the `verdi shell`, define a cubic unit cell as a \(3\times3\) matrix, with lattice parameter \(a_{lat}=5.4\) Å:

``` python
 alat = 5.4
 the_cell = [[alat/2,alat/2,0.],[alat/2,0.,alat/2],[0.,alat/2,alat/2]]
```

**Note**: Default units for crystal structure cell and coordinates in AiiDA are Å.

Structures in AiiDA are instances of `StructureData` class: load it in the verdi shell

``` python
 StructureData = DataFactory("structure")
```

Now, initialize the class instance (i.e. is the structure we want to study) by the command

``` python
 structure = StructureData(cell=the_cell)
```

which sets the cubic cell defined before. From now on, you can access the cell with the command

``` python
 structure.cell
```

Finally, append each of the 2 atoms of the cell command. You can do it using commands like

``` python
 structure.append_atom(position=(alat/4.,alat/4.,alat/4.),symbols="Si")
```

for the first ‘Si’ atom. Repeat it for the other atomic site \(\left(0,0,0\right)\). You can access and inspect[2] the structure sites with the command

``` python
 structure.sites
```

If you make a mistake, start over from `structure = StructureData(cell=the_cell)`, or equivalently use
`structure.clear_kinds()` to remove all kinds (atomic species) and sites. Alternatively, AiiDA structures can also be converted directly from ASE  structures using[3]

``` python
 from ase.lattice.spacegroup import crystal
 ase_structure = crystal('Si', [(0,0,0)], spacegroup=227,
                 cellpar=[alat, alat, alat, 90, 90, 90],primitive_cell=True)
 structure=StructureData(ase=ase_structure)
```

Now you can store the new structure object in the database with the command:

``` python
 structure.store()
```

Finally, we can also import the silicon structure from an external (online) repository such as the Crystallography Open Database :

``` python
from aiida.tools.dbimporters.plugins.cod import CodDbImporter
importer = CodDbImporter()
for entry in importer.query(formula='Si',spacegroup='F d -3 m'):
        structure = entry.get_aiida_structure()
        print "Formula", structure.get_formula()
        print "Unit cell volume: ", structure.get_cell_volume()
```

In that case two duplicate structures are found for Si.

## Accessing inputs and outputs

Load again the calculation node used in Section [loadnode]:

``` python
 calc = load_node(PK)
```

Then type

``` python
 calc.inp.
```

and press `TAB`: you will see all the link names between the calculation and its input nodes. You can use a specific linkname to access the corresponding input node, e.g.:

``` python
 calc.inp.structure
```

You can use the `inp` method multiple times in order to browse the graph. For instance, if the input structure node that you just accessed is the output of another calculation, you can access the latter by typing

``` python
 calc2 = calc.inp.structure.inp.output_structure
```

Here `calc2` is the `PwCalculation` that produced the structure used as an input for `calc`.

Similarly, if you type:

``` python
 calc2.out.
```

and then `TAB`, you will list all output link names of the calculation. One of them leads to the structure that was the input of `calc` we loaded previously:

``` python
 calc2.out.output_structure
```

Note that links have a single name, that was assigned by the calculation that used the corresponding input or produced the corresponding output, as illustrated in Fig. [fig:graph].

For a more programmatic approach, you can get a list of the inputs and outputs of a node, say `calc`, with the methods

``` python
 calc.get_inputs()
 calc.get_outputs()
```

Alternatively, you can get a dictionary where the keys are the link names and the values are the linked objects, with the methods

``` python
 calc.get_inputs_dict()
 calc.get_outputs_dict()
```

Note: You will sometime see entries in the dictionary with names like `output_kpoints_3511`. These exist because standard python dictionaries require unique key names while link labels may not be unique. Therefore, we use the link label plus the PK separated by underscores.

## Pseudopotential families

Pseudopotentials in AiiDA are grouped in “families” that contain one single pseudo per element. We will see how to work with UPF pseudopotentials (the format used by Quantum ESPRESSO and some other codes).
Download and untar the SSSP  pseudopotentials via the commands:

```console
 wget https://archive.materialscloud.org/file/2018.0001/v1/SSSP_efficiency_pseudos.tar.gz
 tar -zxvf SSSP_efficiency_pseudos.tar.gz
```

Then you can upload the whole set of pseudopotentials to AiiDA by to the following `verdi` command:

```console
verdi data upf uploadfamily SSSP_efficiency_pseudos 'SSSP' 'SSSP pseudopotential library'
```

In the command above, `SSSP_efficiency_pseudos` is the folder containing the pseudopotentials, ’SSSP’ is the name given to the family and the last argument is its description.
Finally, you can list all the pseudo families present in the database with

```console
 verdi data upf listfamilies
```
