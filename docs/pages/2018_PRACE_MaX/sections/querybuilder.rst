Queries in AiiDA: The Querybuilder
==================================

This part of the tutorial is provided only in interactive mode through a
Jupyter notebook, which you will be able to run in your browser. To
accomplish this we first need to start the Jupyter server, if you didnâ€™t
do it already at the very beginning of the tutorial. First make sure you
are connected to the virtual machine with local forwarding enabled, as
described in section [sec:sshintro]. Then, on the virtual machine, first
make sure your are in the ``aiida`` virtual environment:

.. code:: console

    workon aiida

If the virtual environment is successfully loaded, your prompt should be
prefixed with ``(aiida)``. To finally launch the Jupyter server, execute
the following commands:

.. code:: console

    cd ~/examples/aiida-demos/tutorial/
    jupyter notebook --no-browser

If all went well, you should now be able to open up a browser on your
local machine and point it to the following address
``http://localhost:8888/?token=2a3ba3...`` (replace the token with the
one printed on output by the previous command). This should now show you
a directory navigator.

To open the notebook, click on ``querybuilder`` and then select the file
``tutorial.ipynb``. Note that there is also a ``solution.ipynb``, which is a
copy of the same notebook, but which contains the solutions to all the
exercises. You can use this version at your own discretion if you get stuck at
some point (but we suggest that you try not to look at it at first).

See below for a rendered version of the notebook, that can also be downloaded
from :download:`here <../notebooks/querybuilder-tutorial.ipynb>`.

The solutions can also be downloaded from
:download:`here <../notebooks/querybuilder-solutions.ipynb>`: but again,
try not to use them at first!
