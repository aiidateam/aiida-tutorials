AiiDA Workflows
===============

The aim of the last part of this tutorial is to introduce the concept of
workflows in AiiDA.

In this section, we will ask you to:

1. Understand how to keep the provenance when running small python
   scripts to convert one data object into another (postprocessing,
   preparation of inputs, …)

2. Understand how to represent simple python functions in the AiiDA
   database

3. Learn how to write a simple workflow in AiiDA (without and with
   remote calculation submission)

4. Learn how to write a workflow with checkpoints: this means that, even
   if your workflows requires external calculations to start, them and
   their dependences are managed through the daemon. While you are
   waiting for the calculations to complete, you can stop and even
   shutdown the computer in which AiiDA is running. When you restart,
   the workflow will continue from where it was.

5. (optional) Go a bit deeper in the syntax of workflows with
   checkpoints (WorkChain), e.g. implementing a convergence workflow
   using ``while`` loops.

A note: this is probably the most “complex” part of the tutorial. We
suggest that you try to understand the underlying logic behind the
scripts, without focusing too much on the details of the workflows
implementation or the syntax. If you want, you can then focus more on
the technicalities in a second reading.

Introduction
------------

The ultimate aim of this section is to create a workflow to calculate
the equation of state of silicon. This is a very common task for an *ab
initio* researcher. An equation of state consists in calculating the
total energy (E) as a function of the unit cell volume (V). The minimal
energy is reached at the equilibrium volume (V^{}). Equivalently, the
equilibrium is defined by a vanishing pressure (p=-dE/dV). In the
vicinity of the minimum, the functional form of the equation of state
can be approximated by a parabola. Such an approximation greatly
simplifies the calculation of the bulk modulus, that is proportional to
the second derivative of the energy (d:sup:`2E/dV`\ 2) (a more advanced
treatment requires fitting the curve with, e.g., the Birch–Murnaghan
expression).

The process of calculating an equation of state puts together several
operations. First, we need to define and store in the AiiDA database the
basic structure of, e.g., bulk Si. Next, one has to define several
structures with different lattice parameters. Those structures must be
connected between them in the database, in order to ensure that their
provenance is recorded. In other words, we want to be sure that in the
future we will know that if we find a bunch of rescaled structures in
the database, they all descend from the same one. How to link two nodes
in the database in a easy way is the subject of Sec. [sec:provenancewf].

In the following sections, the newly created structures will then serve
as an input for total energy calculations performed, in this tutorial,
with Quantum ESPRESSO. This task is very similar to what you have done
in the previous part of the tutorial. Finally, you will fit the
resulting energies as a function of volume to get the bulk modulus. As
the EOS task is very common, we will show how to automate its
computation with workflows, and how to deal with both serial and
parallel (i.e., independent) execution of multiple tasks. Finally, we
will show how to introduce more complex logic in your workflows such as
loops and conditional statements (Sec. [sec:convpressure]), with an
example on a convergence loop to find iteratively the minimum of an EOS.

   Typical graphs created by using a workfunction. (a) The workfunction
   ``create_structure`` takes a ``Str`` object as input and returns a single
   ``StructureData`` object which is used as input for the workfunction
   ``rescale`` together with a ``Float`` object. This latter workfunction
   returns another ``StructureData`` object, defining a crystal having the
   rescaled lattice constant. (b) Graph generated by nesting workfunctions.
   A wrapper workfunction ``create_rescaled`` calls serially
   ``create_structure`` and ``rescale``. This relationship is stored via
   ``CALL`` links.

Imagine to have a function that takes as input a string of the name of a
chemical element and generates the corresponding bulk structure as a
``StructureData`` object. The function might look like this (you will
find this function in the folder
``/home/aiida/tutorial_scripts/create_rescale.py`` on your virtual
machine):

.. code:: python

    def create_diamond_fcc(element):
        """
        Workfunction to create the crystal structure of a given element.
        For simplicity, only Si and Ge are valid elements.
        :param element: The element to create the structure with.
        :return: The structure.
        """
        import numpy as np
        elem_alat= {
                    "Si": 5.431, # Angstrom
                    "Ge": 5.658,
                   }

        # Validate input element
        symbol = str(element)
        if symbol not in elem_alat.keys():
           raise ValueError("Valid elements are only Si and Ge")

        # Create cel starting having lattice parameter alat corresponding to the element
        alat = elem_alat[symbol]
        the_cell = np.array([[0., 0.5, 0.5],
                             [0.5, 0., 0.5],
                             [0.5, 0.5, 0.]]) * alat

        # Create a structure data object
        StructureData = DataFactory("structure")
        structure = StructureData(cell=the_cell)
        structure.append_atom(position=(0., 0., 0.), symbols=str(element))
        structure.append_atom(position=(0.25*alat, 0.25*alat, 0.25*alat),
                              symbols=str(element))
        return structure

For the equation of state you need another function that takes as input
a ``StructureData`` object and a rescaling factor, and returns a
``StructureData`` object with the rescaled lattice parameter (you will
find this function in the same file ``create_rescale.py`` on your
virtual machine):

.. code:: python

    def rescale(structure, scale):
        """
        Workfunction to rescale a structure

        :param structure: An AiiDA structure to rescale
        :param scale: The scale factor (for the lattice constant)
        :return: The rescaled structure
        """
        the_ase = structure.get_ase()
        new_ase = the_ase.copy()
        new_ase.set_cell(the_ase.get_cell() * float(scale), scale_atoms=True)
        new_structure = DataFactory('structure')(ase=new_ase)
        return new_structure

In order to generate the rescaled starting structures, say for five
different lattice parameters you would combine the two functions. Enter
the following commands in the ``verdi shell`` from the
``tutorial_scripts`` folder.

.. code:: python

    from create_rescale import create_diamond_fcc, rescale

    s0 = create_diamond_fcc("Si")
    rescaled_structures = [rescale(s0, factor) for factor 
                          in (0.98, 0.99, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)]

and store them in the database:

.. code:: python

    s0.store()
    for struct in rescaled_structures:
       struct.store()

Run the commands above to store all the structures.

As expected, all the structures that you have created are not linked in
any manner as you can verify via the ``get_inputs()/get_outputs()``
methods of the StuctureData class. Instead, you would like these objects
to be connected as sketched in Fig. [Fig:workfunctions]a. Now that you
are familiar with AiiDA, you know that the way to connect two data nodes
is through a calculation. In order to “wrap” python functions and
automate the generation of the needed links, in AiiDA we provide you
with what we call “workfunctions”. A normal function can be converted to
a workfunction by using the ``@workfunction`` decorator[9] that takes
care of storing the execution as a calculation and adding the links
between the input and output data nodes.

In our case, what you need to do is to modify the two functions as
follows (note that we import ``workfunction`` as ``wf`` to be shorter,
but this is not required). You can do it in the file
``create_rescale.py``:

.. code:: python

    # Add this import
    from aiida.work import workfunction as wf
     
    # Add decorators
    @wf
    def create_diamond_fcc(element):
        ...
        ...
     
    @wf
    def rescale(structure, scale):
        ...
        ...

*Important*: when you use workfunctions, you have to make sure that
their input and output are actually Data nodes, so that they can be
stored in the database. AiiDA objects such as ``StructureData``,
ParameterData, etc. carry around information about their provenance as
stored in the database. This is why we must use the special
database-storable types Float, Str, etc. as shown in the snippet below.

Try now to run the following script:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.orm.data.base import Float, Str
    from create_rescale import create_diamond_fcc, rescale

    s0 = create_diamond_fcc(Str("Si"))
    rescaled_structures = [rescale(s0,Float(factor)) for factor in (0.98, 0.99, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)]

and check now that the output of ``s0`` as well as the input of the
rescaled structures point to an intermediate ProcessCalculation node,
representing the execution of the workfunction, see
Fig. [Fig:workfunctions].

For instance, you can check that the output links of ``s0`` are the five
``rescale`` calculations:

.. code:: python

    s0.get_outputs()

which outputs

.. code:: python

    [<FunctionCalculation: uuid: 01b0b137-974c-4d80-974f-ea4978b12019 (pk: 4970)>,
     <FunctionCalculation: uuid: 1af5ead6-0ae0-42a7-969c-1f0e88300f4a (pk: 4973)>,
     <FunctionCalculation: uuid: 22dee9d5-0382-48a3-9319-e800506946f1 (pk: 4976)>,
     <FunctionCalculation: uuid: dc4c93b7-3e7a-4f51-8d44-cf15c5707ddb (pk: 4979)>,
     <FunctionCalculation: uuid: f5b4e9f2-0d50-4b3d-a76b-7a12d232ea54 (pk: 4982)>]

and the inputs of each ProcessCalculation (“rescale”) are obtained with:

.. code:: python

    for s in s0.get_outputs():
         print s.get_inputs()

that will return

.. code:: python

    [0.98, <StructureData: uuid: 9b76b5fa-2908-4f88-a4fb-7a9aa343a1f3 (pk: 4968)>]
    [0.99, <StructureData: uuid: 9b76b5fa-2908-4f88-a4fb-7a9aa343a1f3 (pk: 4968)>]
    [1.0, <StructureData: uuid: 9b76b5fa-2908-4f88-a4fb-7a9aa343a1f3 (pk: 4968)>]
    [1.1, <StructureData: uuid: 9b76b5fa-2908-4f88-a4fb-7a9aa343a1f3 (pk: 4968)>]
    [1.2, <StructureData: uuid: 9b76b5fa-2908-4f88-a4fb-7a9aa343a1f3 (pk: 4968)>]

Workfunction nesting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One key advantage of workfunctions is that they can be nested, namely, a
workfunction can invoke workfunctions inside its definition, and this
“call” relationship will also be automatically recorded in the database.
As an example, let us combine the two previously defined workfunctions
by means of a wrapper workfunction called “create\_rescaled” that takes
as input the element and the rescale factor.

Type in your shell (or modify the functions defined in
``create_rescale.py`` and then run):

.. code:: python

    @wf
    def create_rescaled(element, scale):
        """
        Workfunction to create and immediately rescale
        a crystal structure of a given element.
        """
        s0 = create_diamond_fcc(element)
        return rescale(s0,scale)

and create an already rescaled structure by typing

.. code:: python

    s1 = create_rescaled(element=Str("Si"), scale=Float(0.98))

Now inspect the input links of ``s1``:

.. code:: python

    In [6]: s1.get_inputs()
    Out[6]: 
    [<FunctionCalculation: uuid: a672317b-3091-4135-9d84-12c2fff34bfe (pk: 5005)>,
     <FunctionCalculation: uuid: a672317b-3091-4135-9d84-12c2fff34bfe (pk: 5005)>,
     <FunctionCalculation: uuid: f64f4a70-70ff-4551-ba4d-c186328d8bd6 (pk: 5002)>]

The object ``s1`` has three incoming links, corresponding to *two*
different calculations as input (in this case, pks 5002 and 5005). These
correspond to the calculations “create\_rescaled” and “rescale” as shown
in Fig. [Fig:workfunctions]b. It is normal that calculation 5005 has two
links, don’t worry about that[10]. To see the “call” link, inspect now
the outputs of the calculation appearing only once in the list. Write
down its ``<pk>`` (in general, it will be different from 5002), then in
the shell load the corresponding node and inspect the outputs:

.. code:: python

    In [12]: p1 = load_node(<pk>)
    In [13]: p1.get_outputs_dict()

You should be able to identify the two \`\`children" calculations as
well as the final structure (you will see the calculations linked via
CALL links: these are calculation-to-calculation links representing the
fact that ``create_rescaled`` called two sub-workfunctions). The
graphical representation of what you have in the database should match
Fig. [Fig:workfunctions]b.

[sec:sync] Run a simple workflow
--------------------------------

Let us now use the workfunctions that we have just created to build a
simple workflow to calculate the equation of state of silicon. We will
consider five different values of the lattice parameter obtained
rescaling the experimental minimum, (a=5.431~), by a factor in ([0.96,
0.98, 1.0, 1.02, 1.04]). We will write a simple script that runs a
series of five calculations and at the end returns the volume and the
total energy corresponding to each value of the lattice parameter. For
your convenience, besides the functions that you have written so far in
the file ``create_rescale.py``, we provide you with some other utilities
to get the correct pseudopotential and to generate a pw input file, in
the module ``common_wf.py`` which has been put in the
``tutorial_scripts`` folder.

We have already created the following script named
``simple_sync_workflow.py``, which you are free to look at but please go
through the lines carefully and make sure you understand them. If you
decide to create your own new script, make sure to also place it in the
folder ``tutorial_scripts``, otherwise the imports won’t work.

Besides the functions in the local folder

.. code:: python

    from create_rescale import create_diamond_fcc, rescale
    from common_wf import generate_scf_input_params

you need to import few further AiiDA classes and functions:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.work import run, Process
    from aiida.work import workfunction as wf
    from aiida.orm.data.base import Str, Float
    from aiida.orm import CalculationFactory, DataFactory

The only imported function that deserves an explanation is ``run``. For
the time being, you just need to know that it is a function that needs
to be used to execute a new workflow. The actual body of the script is
the following. We suggest that you first have a careful look at it
before running it.

.. code:: python

    # Load the calculation class 'PwCalculation' using its entry point 'quantumespresso.pw'
    PwCalculation = CalculationFactory('quantumespresso.pw')

    scale_facs = (0.96, 0.98, 1.0, 1.02, 1.04)
    labels = ["c1", "c2", "c3", "c4", "c5"]

    @wf
    def run_eos_wf(codename, pseudo_family, element):
        print "Workfunction node identifiers: {}".format(Process.current().calc)
        s0 = create_diamond_fcc(Str(element))

        calcs = {}
        for label, factor in zip(labels, scale_facs):
            s = rescale(s0, Float(factor))
            inputs = generate_scf_input_params(s, str(codename), Str(pseudo_family))
            print "Running a scf for {} with scale factor {}".format(element, factor)
            result = run(PwCalculation, **inputs)
            print "RESULT: {}".format(result)
            calcs[label] = get_info(result)

        eos = []
        for label in labels:
            eos.append(calcs[label])

        # Return information to plot the EOS
        ParameterData = DataFactory("parameter")
        retdict = {
                'initial_structure': s0,
                'result': ParameterData(dict={'eos_data': eos})
            }

        return retdict

If you look into the previous snippets of code, you will notice that the
way we submit a QE calculation is slightly different from what you have
seen in the first part of the tutorial. The following:

.. code:: python

    result = run(PwCalculation, **inputs)

runs in the current python session (without the daemon), waits for its
completion and returns the output in the user-defined variable
``result``. The latter is a dictionary whose values are the output nodes
generated by the calculation, with the link labels as keys. For example,
once the calculation is finished, in order to access the total energy,
we need to access the ParameterData node which is linked via the
“output\_parameters” link (see again Fig. 1 of Day 1 Tutorial, to see
inputs and outputs of a Quantum ESPRESSO calculation). Once the right
node is retrieved as ``result[output_parameters]``, we need to get the
``energy`` attribute. The global operation is achieved by the command

.. code:: python

    result['output_parameters'].dict.energy

As you see, the function ``run_eos_wf`` has been decorated as a
workfunction to keep track of the provenance. Finally, in order to get
the ``<pk>`` associated to the workfunction (and print on the screen for
our later reference), we have used the following command to get the node
corresponding to the ProcessCalculation:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.work import Process
    print Process.current().calc

To run the workflow it suffices to call the function ``run_eos_wf`` in a
python script providing the required input parameters. For simplicity,
we have included few lines at the end of the script that invoke the
function with a static choice of parameters:

.. code:: python

    def run_eos(codename='pw-5.1@localhost', pseudo_family='GBRV_lda', element="Si"):
        return run_eos_wf(Str(codename), Str(pseudo_family), Str(element))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run_eos() 

Run the workflow by running the following command from the
``tutorial_scripts`` directory:

.. code:: console

    verdi run simple_sync_workflow.py

and write down the ``<pk>`` of the ProcessCalculation printed on screen
at execution.

The command above locks the shell until the full workflow has completed
(we will see in a moment how to avoid this). While the calculation is
running, you can use (in a different shell) the command
``verdi work list`` to show ongoing and finished workfunctions. You can
“grep” for the ``<pk>`` you are interested in. Additionally, you can use
the command ``verdi work status <pk>`` to show the tree of the
sub-workfunctions called by the root workfunction with a given ``<pk>``.

Wait for the calculation to finish, then call the function
``plot_eos(<pk>)`` that we provided in the file ``common_wf.py`` to plot
the equation of state and fit it with a Birch–Murnaghan equation.

[sec:wf-multiple-calcs]Run multiple calculations
------------------------------------------------

You should have noticed that the calculations for different lattice
parameters are executed serially, although they might perfectly be
executed in parallel because their inputs and outputs are not connected
in any way. In the language of workflows, these calculations are
executed in a synchronous (or blocking) way, whereas we would like to
have them running *asynchronously* (i.e., in a non-blocking way, to run
them in parallel). One way to achieve this to submit the calculation to
the daemon using the ``submit`` function. Make a copy of the script
``simple_sync_workflow.py`` that we worked on in the previous section
and name it ``simple_submit_workflow.py``. To make the new script work
asynchronously, simply change the following subset of lines:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.work import run
    [...]
    for label, factor in zip(labels, scale_facs):
        [...]
        result = run(PwCalculation, **inputs)
        calcs[label] = get_info(result)
    [...]
    eos = []
    for label in labels:
        eos.append(calcs[label])

replacing them with

.. code:: python

    from aiida.work import submit
    from time import sleep
    [...]
    for label, factor in zip(labels, scale_facs):
        [...]
        calcs[label] = submit(PwCalculation, **inputs)
    [...]
    # Wait for the calculations to finish
    for calc in calcs.values():
        while not calc.is_finished:
            sleep(1)

    eos = []
    for label in labels:
        eos.append(get_info(calcs[label].get_outputs_dict()))

The main differences are:

-  ``run`` is replaced by ``submit``

-  The return value of ``submit`` is not a dictionary describing the
   outputs of the calculation, but it is the calculation node for that
   submission.

-  Each calculation starts in the background and calculation nodes are
   added to the ``calc`` dictionary.

-  At the end of the loop, when all calculations have been launched with
   ``submit``, another loop is used to wait for all calculations to
   finish before gathering the results as the final step.

In the next section we will show you another way to achieve this, which
has the added bonus that it introduces checkpoints in the workfunction,
from which the calculation can be resumed should it be interrupted.

After applying the modifications, run the script. You will see that all
calculations start at the same time, without waiting for the previous
ones to finish.

If in the meantime you run ``verdi work status <pk>``, all five
calculations are already shown as output. Also, if you run
``verdi calculation list``, you will see how the calculations are
submitted to the scheduler.

[sec:workchainsimple]Workchains, or how not to get lost if your computer shuts down or crashes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simple workflows that we have used so far have been launched by a
python script that needs to be running for the whole time of the
execution, namely the time in which the calculations are submitted, and
the actual time needed by Quantum ESPRESSO to perform the calculation
and the time taken to retrieve the results. If you had killed the main
python process during this time, the workflow would not have terminated
correctly. Perhaps you have kill the calculation and you experienced the
unpleasant consequences: intermediate calculation results are
potentially lost and it is extremely difficult to restart a workflow
from the exact place where it stopped.

In order to overcome this limitation, in AiiDA we have implemented a way
to insert checkpoints, where the main code defining a workflow can be
stopped (you can even shut down the machine on which AiiDA is running!).
We call these workfunctions with checkpoints “workchains” because, as
you will see, they basically amount to splitting a workfunction in a
chain of steps. Each step is then ran by the daemon, in a way similar to
the remote calculations.

The basic rules that allow you to convert your workfunction-based script
to a workchain-based one are listed in Table [Tab:wf2frag], which focus
on the code used to perform the calculation of an equation of state. The
modifications needed are put side-to-side to allow for a direct
comparison. In the following, when referencing a specific part of the
code we will refer to the line number appearing in Table [Tab:wf2frag].

            eos = []
            for label in labels:
                eos.append(get_info(self.ctx[label].get_outputs_dict()))

            # Return information to plot the EOS
            ParameterData = DataFactory('parameter')
            retdict = {
                    'initial_structure': self.ctx.s0,
                    'result': ParameterData(dict={'eos_data': eos})
               }

-  Instead of using decorated functions you need to define a class,
   inheriting from a prototype class called ``WorkChain`` that is
   provided by AiiDA (line 4)

-  Within your class you need to implement a ``define`` classmethod that
   always takes ``cls`` and ``spec`` as inputs. (lines 6–7). Here you
   specify the main information on the workchain, in particular:

   -  the *inputs* that the workchain expects. This is obtained by means
      of the method, which provides as the key feature the automatic
      validation of the input types via the ``valid_type`` argument
      (lines 8–10). The same holds true for outputs, as you can use the
      ``spec.output()`` method to state what output types are expected
      to be returned by the workchain. Both ``spec.input()`` and
      ``spec.output()`` methods are optional, and if not specified, the
      workchain will accept any set of inputs and will not perform any
      check on the outputs, as long as the values are database storable
      AiiDA types.

   -  the ``outline`` consisting in a list of “steps” that you want to
      run, put in the right sequence (lines 11–14). This is obtained by
      means of the method ``spec.outline()`` which takes as input the
      steps. *Note*: in this example we just split the main execution in
      two sequential steps, that is, first ``run_pw`` then
      ``return_results``. However, more complex logic is allowed, as
      will be explained in the Sec. [sec:convpressure].

-  You need to split your main code into methods, with the names you
   specified before into the outline (``run_pw`` and ``return_results``
   in this example, lines 17 and 35). Where exactly should you split the
   code? Well, the splitting points should be put where you would
   normally block the execution of the script for collecting results in
   a standard workfunction, namely whenever you call the method
   ``.result()``. Each method should accept only one parameter,
   ``self``, e.g. ``def step_name(self)``.

-  You will notice that the methods reference the attribute ``ctx``
   through ``self.ctx``, which is called the *context* and is inherited
   from the base class ``WorkChain``. A python function or workfunction
   normally just stores variables in the local scope of the function.
   For instance, in the example of the subsection [sec:sync], you stored
   the ``calc_results`` in the ``eos`` list, that was a local variable.
   In workchains, instead, to preserve variables between different
   steps, you need to store them in a special dictionary called
   *context*. As explained above, the context variable ``ctx`` is
   inherited from the base class ``WorkChain``, and at each step method
   you just need to update its content. AiiDA will take care of saving
   the context somewhere between workflow steps (on disk, in the
   database, …, depending on how AiiDA was configured). For your
   convenience, you can also access the value of a context variable as
   ``self.ctx.varname`` instead of ``self.ctx[’varname’]`` (see e.g.
   lines 19, 24, 38, 43).

-  Any submission within the workflow should not call the normal ``run``
   or ``submit`` functions, but ``self.submit`` to which you have to
   pass the Process class, and a dictionary of inputs (line 28).

-  The submission in line 28, returns a future and not the actual
   calculation, because at that point in time we have only just launched
   the calculation to the daemon and it is not yet completed. Therefore
   it literally is a “future” result. Yet we still need to add these
   futures to the context, so that in the next step of the workchain,
   when the calculations are in fact completed, we can access them and
   continue the work. To do this, we can use the ``ToContext`` class.
   This class takes a dictionary, where the values are the futures and
   the keys will be the names under which the corresponding calculations
   will be made available in the context when they are done. See line 33
   how the ``ToContext`` object is created and returned from the step.
   By doing this, the workchain will implicitly wait for the results of
   all the futures you have specified, and then call the next step *only
   when all futures have completed*.

-  *Return values*: While in a normal workfunction you attach output
   nodes to the ``FunctionCalculation`` by invoking the *return*
   statement, in a workchain you need to call
   ``self.out(link_name, node)`` for each node you want to return (line
   46-47). Of course, if you have already prepared a dictionary of
   outputs, you can just use the following syntax:

   .. code:: python

       self.out_many(retdict)  # Keys are link names, value the nodes

   The advantage of this different syntax is that you can start emitting
   output nodes already in the middle of the execution, and not
   necessarily at the very end as it happens for normal functions
   (*return* is always the last instruction executed in a function).
   Also, note that once you have called ``self.out(link_name, node)`` on
   a given ``link_name``, you can no longer call ``self.out()`` on the
   same ``link_name``: this will raise an exception.

Inspect the example in the table that compares the two versions of
workfunctions to understand in detail the different syntaxes.

Finally, the workflow has to be run. For this you have to use the
function ``run`` passing as arguments the ``EquationOfStates`` class and
the inputs as key-value arguments. For example, you can execute

.. code:: python

     run(EquationOfStates, element=Str('Si'), code=Str('qe-pw-6.2.1@localhost'),
         pseudo_family=Str('GBRV_lda'))

While the workflow is running, you can check (in a different terminal)
what is happening to the calculations using ``verdi calculation list``.
You will see that after a few seconds the calculations are all submitted
to the scheduler and can potentially run at the same time.

**Note:** You will see warnings that say
``Exception trying to save checkpoint, this means you will not be able to restart in case of a crash until the next successful checkpoint``,
these are generated by the ``PwCalculation`` which is unable to save a
checkpoint because it is not in a so called ‘importable path’. Simply
put this means that if AiiDA were to try and reload the class it
wouldn’t know which file to find it in. To get around this you could
simply put the workchain in a different file that is in the ‘PYTHONPATH’
and then launch it by importing it in your launch file, this way AiiDA
knows where to find it next time it loads the checkpoint.

As an additional exercise (optional), instead of running the main
workflow (``EquationOfStates``), try to submit it. Note that the file
where the WorkChain is defined will need to be globally importable (so
the daemon knows how to load it) and you need to launch it (with
``submit``) from a different python file. The easiest way to achieve
this is typically to embed the workflow inside a python package.

**Note:** As good practice, you should try to keep the steps as short as
possible in term of execution time. The reason is that the daemon can be
stopped and restarted only between execution steps and not if a step is
in the middle of a long execution.

Finally, as an optional exercise if you have time, you can jump to the
Appendix [sec:convpressure], which shows how to introduce more complex
logic into your WorkChains (if conditionals, while loops etc.). The
exercise will show how to realize a convergence loop to obtain the
minimum-volume structure in a EOS using the Newton’s algorithm.
