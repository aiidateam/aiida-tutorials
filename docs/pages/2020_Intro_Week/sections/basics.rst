Verdi command line
==================

This part of the tutorial will help you familiarize with the ``verdi`` command-line interface (CLI),
which lets you manage your AiiDA installation, inspect the contents of your database, control running calculations and more.

.. note:: Remember to run ``workon aiida`` in any new shell, in order to enter the correct virtual environment,
   otherwise the ``verdi`` command will not be available.

* The ``verdi`` command supports **tab-completion**:
  In the terminal, type ``verdi``, followed by a space and press the 'Tab' key twice to show a list of all the available sub commands.
* For help on ``verdi`` or any of its subcommands, simply append the ``--help/-h`` flag, e.g.:

  .. code:: bash

    verdi quicksetup -h

More details on ``verdi`` can be found in the `online documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/cli.html>`_.

.. _2020_virtual_intro:setup_profile:

Setting up a profile
--------------------

After installing AiiDA, the first step is to create a "profile".
Typically, you would be using one profile per independent research project.

The easiest way of setting up a new profile is through ``verdi quicksetup``.
Let's set up a new profile that we will use throughout this tutorial:

.. code:: bash

    verdi quicksetup

This will prompt you for some information, such as the name of the profile, your name, etc.
The information about you as a user will be associated with all the data that you create in AiiDA
and it is important for attribution when you will later share your data with others.
After you have answered all the questions, a new profile will be created, along
with the required database and repository.

.. note::

    ``verdi quicksetup`` is a user-friendly wrapper around the ``verdi setup`` command that provides more control over the profile setup.
    As explained in `the documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/intro/installation.html#aiida-profile-custom-setup>`_, ``verdi setup`` expects certain external resources (such as the database and RabbitMQ) to already have been pre-configured.
    ``verdi quicksetup`` will try to do this for you, but may not be successful in certain environments.

To check that a new profile has been generated (in our case, called ``quicksetup``), along with any other that may have been already configured, run:

.. code:: bash

    verdi profile list

    Info: configuration folder: /home/max/.aiida
    * generic
      quicksetup

Each line, ``generic`` and ``quicksetup`` in this example, corresponds to a profile.
The one marked with an asterisk is the "default" profile, meaning that any ``verdi`` command that you execute will be applied to that profile.

.. note::

    The output you will get may differ.
    The ``generic`` profile is pre-configured on the virtual machine built for the tutorial (but we are not going to use it here).

Let's change the default profile to the newly created ``quicksetup`` for the rest of the tutorial:

.. code:: bash

    verdi profile setdefault quicksetup

From now on, all ``verdi`` commands will apply to the ``quicksetup`` profile.

.. note::

    To quickly perform a single command on a profile that is not the default, use the ``-p/--profile`` option:
    For example, ``verdi -p generic code list`` will display the codes for the ``generic`` profile, despite it not being the current default profile.

.. _2020_virtual_importing_data:

Importing data
--------------

Before we start running calculations ourselves, we are going to look at an AiiDA database already created by someone else.
Let's import one from the web:

.. code:: bash

    verdi import https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_b1d80408b3d340db9f03d373bbde5c1e/marvel-vms/tutorials/aiida_tutorial_2020_07_perovskites_v0.9.aiida

Contrary to most databases, AiiDA databases contain not only *results* of calculations but also their inputs and information on how a particular result was obtained.
This information, the *data provenance*, is stored in the form of a *directed acyclic graph* (DAG).
In the following, we are going to introduce you to different ways of browsing this graph and will ask you to find out some information regarding the database you just imported.

.. _2020_virtual_aiidagraph:

Your first AiiDA graph
----------------------

:numref:`2020_virtual_fig_graph_input_only` shows a typical example of a calculation represented in an AiiDA graph.
Have a look to the figure and its caption before moving on.

.. _2020_virtual_fig_graph_input_only:
.. figure:: include/images/verdi_graph/batio3/graph-input.png
   :width: 100%

   Graph with all inputs (data, circles; and code, diamond) to the Quantum ESPRESSO calculation (square) that you will create in the :ref:`2020_virtual_intro:running` section of this tutorial.

.. figure:: include/images/verdi_graph/batio3/graph-full.png
   :width: 100%

   Same as :numref:`2020_virtual_fig_graph_input_only`, but also with the outputs that the engine will create and connect automatically.
   The ``RemoteData`` node is created during submission and can be thought as a symbolic link to the remote folder in which the calculation runs on the cluster.
   The other nodes are created when the calculation has finished, after retrieval and parsing.
   The node with linkname ``retrieved`` contains the relevant raw output files stored in the AiiDA repository; all other nodes are added by the parser.
   Additional nodes (symbolized in gray) can be added by the parser: e.g., an output ``StructureData`` if you performed a relaxation calculation, a ``TrajectoryData`` for molecular dynamics, etc.

:numref:`2020_virtual_fig_graph_input_only` was drawn by hand but you can generate a similar graph automatically by passing the **identifier** of a calculation node to ``verdi node graph generate <IDENTIFIER>``.
Identifiers in AiiDA come in three forms:

 * "Primary Key" (PK): An integer, e.g. ``723``, that identifies your entity within your database (automatically assigned)
 * `Universally Unique Identifier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)>`_ (UUID): A string, e.g. ``ce81c420-7751-48f6-af8e-eb7c6a30cec3`` that identifies your entity globally (automatically assigned)
 * Label: A human-readable string, e.g. ``test_qe_calculation`` (manually assigned)

Any ``verdi`` command that expects an identifier will accept a PK, a UUID or a label (although not all entities have a label by default).
While PKs are often shorter than UUIDs and can be easier to remember, they are only unique within your database.
**Whenever you intend to share your data with others, use UUIDs to refer to nodes.**

.. note::
    For UUIDs, it is sufficient to specify a subset (starting at the beginning) as long as it can already be uniquely resolved.
    For more information on identifiers in ``verdi`` and AiiDA in general, see the `documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/cli.html#topics-cli-identifiers>`_.

For the remainder of this section, fields enclosed in angular brackets (such as ``<IDENTIFIER>``) are placeholders that you should replace before executing the command.
With that in mind, let's generate a graph for the calculation node with UUID ``ce81c420-7751-48f6-af8e-eb7c6a30cec3``:

.. code:: bash

    verdi node graph generate <IDENTIFIER>

This command will create the file ``<PK>.dot.pdf`` that can be viewed with any PDF document viewer.

You can open this file on the Amazon machine by using ``evince`` or, if the ssh connection is too slow, copy it via ``scp`` to your local machine.
To do so, if you are using Linux/Mac OS X, you can type in your *local* machine:

.. code:: bash

    scp aiidatutorial:<path_with_the_graph_pdf> <local_folder>

and then open the file.

.. note::

    You can also use the ``jupyter notebook`` setup explained :ref:`here <2020_virtual_intro:setup:jupyter>` to download files.
    Note that while Firefox will display the PDF directly in the browser `Chrome and Safari block viewing PDFs from jupyter notebook servers <https://stackoverflow.com/a/55264795/1069467>`_ - with these browsers, you will need to tick the checkbox next to the PDF and download the file.

    Alternatively, you can use graphical software to achieve the same, for instance: on Windows: WinSCP; on a Mac: Cyberduck; on Linux Ubuntu: using the 'Connect to server' option in the main menu after clicking on the desktop.


The provenance browser
----------------------

While the ``verdi`` CLI provides full access to the data underlying the provenance graph, a more intuitive tool for browsing AiiDA graphs is the interactive provenance browser available on `Materials Cloud <https://www.materialscloud.org>`__.

In order to use it, we first need to start the `AiiDA REST API <https://aiida-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/restapi/index.html>`_:

.. code:: bash

    verdi restapi
     * REST API running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v4
     * Serving Flask app "aiida.restapi.run_api" (lazy loading)
     * Environment: production
       WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
       Use a production WSGI server instead.
     * Debug mode: off
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Now you can connect the provenance browser to your local REST API:

-  Open the |provenance_browser| on your laptop
-  In the form, paste the (local) URL ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v4`` of our REST API
-  Click "GO!"

.. |provenance_browser| raw:: html

   <a href="https://www.materialscloud.org/explore/connect" target="_blank">provenance explorer</a>

Once the provenance browser javascript application has been loaded by your browser, it is communicating directly with the REST API and your data never leaves your computer.

.. note::
    In order for this to work on your laptop, while the REST API is running on the virtual machine, we've enabled SSH tunneling for port ``5000`` in :ref:`2020_virtual_intro:setup`.

Start by clicking on the details of a calculation job and use the graph explorer to complete the exercise below (you can filter by calculation jobs using the menu on the left, under ``Process -> Calculation -> Calculation job``).
If you ever get lost, just go to the "Details" tab, enter ``ce81c420-7751-48f6-af8e-eb7c6a30cec3`` and click on the "GO" button.

.. admonition:: Exercise

   Use the provenance browser in order to figure out:

   -  When was the calculation run and who run it?
   -  Was it a serial or a parallel calculation? How many MPI processes were used?
   -  What inputs did the calculation take?
   -  What code was used and what was the name of the executable?
   -  How many calculations were performed using this code?

Processes
---------

Anything that 'runs' in AiiDA, be it calculations or workflows, is considered a ``Process``.
To get a list of currently running processes, use:

.. code:: bash

    verdi process list

.. note::

    The first time you run this command, it might take a few seconds.
    Subsequent calls will be faster.

which should be empty:

.. code:: bash

    PK    Created    Process label   Process State    Process status
    ----  ---------  --------------  ---------------  ----------------

    Total results: 0

    Info: last time an entry changed state: never

Let's see whether there are any *finished* processes in the database by passing the ``-S/--process-state`` flag:

.. code:: bash

    verdi process list -S finished

This command will list all the processes that have a process state ``Finished`` and should look something like:

.. code:: bash

    PK    Created    Process label   Process State    Process status
    ----  ---------  --------------  ---------------  ----------------
    1178  1653D ago  PwCalculaton    ⏹ Finished [0]
    1953  1653D ago  PwCalculaton    ⏹ Finished [0]
    1734  1653D ago  PwCalculaton    ⏹ Finished [0]
     336  1653D ago  PwCalculaton    ⏹ Finished [0]
    1056  1653D ago  PwCalculaton    ⏹ Finished [0]
    1369  1653D ago  PwCalculaton    ⏹ Finished [0]

    Total results: 6

    Info: last time an entry changed state: never

Processes can be in any of the following states:

    * ``Created``
    * ``Waiting``
    * ``Running``
    * ``Finished``
    * ``Excepted``
    * ``Killed``

The first three states are 'active' states, meaning the process is not done yet, and the last three are 'terminal' states.
Once a process is in a terminal state, it will never become active again.
The `official documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/topics/processes/concepts.html#process-state>`_ contains more details on process states.

In order to list processes of *all* states, use the ``-a/--all`` flag:

.. code:: bash

    verdi process list -a

This command will list all the processes that have *ever* been launched.
As your database will grow, so will the output of this command.
To limit the number of results, you can use the ``-p/--past-days <NUM>`` option, that will only show processes that were created ``NUM`` days ago.
For example, this lists all processes launched since yesterday:

.. code:: bash

    verdi process list -a -p1

.. _2019-aiida-identifiers:

Each row of the output identifies a process with some basic information about its status.
For a more detailed list of properties, you can use ``verdi process show``, but to address any specific process, you need an identifier for it.

Let's revisit the process with the UUID ``ce81c420-7751-48f6-af8e-eb7c6a30cec3``, this time using the CLI:

.. code:: bash

    verdi process show ce81c420-7751-48f6-af8e-eb7c6a30cec

Producing the output:

.. code:: bash

    remote_folder            1811  RemoteData
    retrieved                 787  FolderData


You can use the PKs shown for the inputs and outputs to get more information about those nodes.

.. warning::

    Since the inputs and outputs are ``Data`` nodes, not ``Process`` nodes, use ``verdi node show`` instead.


Dict and CalcJobNode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's investigate some of the nodes appearing in the graph.
From the inputs of the process, let's choose the node of type ``Dict`` with input link name ``parameters`` and type in the terminal:

.. code:: bash

    verdi data dict show <IDENTIFIER>

where ``<IDENTIFIER>`` is the PK of the node.

A ``Dict`` contains a dictionary (i.e. key–value pairs), stored in the database in a format ready to be queried.
We will learn how to run queries later on in this tutorial.
The command above will print the content dictionary, containing the parameters used to define the input file for the calculation.
You can compare the dictionary with the content of the raw input file to Quantum ESPRESSO (that was generated by AiiDA) via the command:

.. code:: bash

    verdi calcjob inputcat <IDENTIFIER>

where you provide the identifier of the calculation node.
Check the consistency of the parameters written in the input file and those stored in the ``Dict`` node.
Even if you don't know the meaning of the input flags of a Quantum ESPRESSO calculation, you should be able to see how the input dictionary has been converted to Fortran namelists.

The previous command just printed the content of the 'default' input file ``aiida.in``.
To see a list of all the files used to run a calculation (input file, submission script, etc.) instead type:

.. code:: bash

    verdi calcjob inputls <IDENTIFIER>

Adding a ``--color`` flag allows you to easily distinguish files from folders by a different coloring.
Once you know the name of the file you want to visualize, you can call the ``verdi calcjob inputcat [PATH]`` command specifying the path of the file to show.
For instance, to see the submission script, you can do:

.. code:: bash

    verdi calcjob inputcat <IDENTIFIER> _aiidasubmit.sh

StructureData
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let us focus on ``StructureData`` objects, which represent a crystal structure.
We can consider for instance the input structure to the calculation we were considering before (it should have the UUID ``3a4b1270``).
Such objects can be inspected interactively by means of an atomic viewer such as the one provided by ``ase``.
AiiDA however supports several other viewers such as ``xcrysden``, ``jmol``, and ``vmd``.
Type in the terminal:

.. code:: bash

    verdi data structure show --format ase <IDENTIFIER>

to show the selected structure, although it will take a few seconds to appear (it has to go over a tunnel on your SSH connection).
You should be able to rotate the view with the right mouse button.

.. note::

    If you receive some errors, make sure you started your SSH connection with the ``-X`` or ``-Y`` flag.

Alternatively, especially if showing them interactively is too slow over SSH, you can export the content of a structure node in various popular formats such as ``xyz`` or ``xsf``.
This is achieved by typing in the terminal:

.. code:: bash

    # verdi data structure export --format xsf <IDENTIFIER> > <IDENTIFIER>.xsf
    verdi data structure export --format xsf 254e5a86 > 254e5a86.xsf

You can open the generated ``xsf`` file and observe the cell and the coordinates.
Then, you can then copy ``<IDENTIFIER>.xsf`` from the Amazon machine to your local one and then visualize it, e.g. with ``xcrysden`` (if you have it installed):

.. code:: bash

    xcrysden --xsf <IDENTIFIER>.xsf


Calculation results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The results of a calculation can be accessed directly from the calculation node.
Type in the terminal:

.. code:: bash

    verdi calcjob res <IDENTIFIER>

which will print the output dictionary of the 'scalar' results parsed by AiiDA at the end of the calculation.
Note that this is actually a shortcut for:

.. code:: bash

    verdi data dict show <IDENTIFIER>

where ``IDENTIFIER`` refers to the ``Dict`` node attached as an output of the calculation node, with link name ``output_parameters``.
By looking at the output of the command, what is the Fermi energy of the calculation with UUID ``ce81c420``?

Similarly to what you did for the calculation inputs, you can access the output files via the commands:

.. code:: bash

    verdi calcjob outputls <IDENTIFIER>

and

.. code:: bash

    verdi calcjob outputcat <IDENTIFIER>

Use the latter to verify that the Fermi energy that you have found in the last step has been extracted correctly from the output file.

.. note::

    Hint: filter the lines containing the string 'Fermi', e.g. using ``grep``, to isolate the relevant lines.

The results of calculations are stored in two ways: ``Dict`` objects are stored in the database, which makes querying them very convenient, whereas ``ArrayData`` objects are stored on the disk.
Once more, use the command ``verdi data array show <IDENTIFIER>`` to determine the Fermi energy obtained from calculation with the UUID ``ce81c420``.
This time you will need to use the identifier of the output ``ArrayData`` of the calculation, with link name ``output_trajectory_array``.
As you might have realized, the difference now is that the whole series of values of the Fermi energy calculated after each relax/vc-relax step are stored.
The choice of what to store in ``Dict`` and ``ArrayData`` nodes is made by the parser of ``pw.x`` implemented in the `aiida-quantumespresso <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-quantumespresso>`__ plugin.

(Optional section) Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AiiDA offers the possibility to attach comments to a any node, in order to be able to remember more easily its details.
Node with UUID prefix ``ce81c420`` should have no comments, but you can add a very instructive one by typing in the terminal:

.. code:: bash

    verdi node comment add "vc-relax of a BaTiO3 done with QE pw.x" -N <IDENTIFIER>

Now, if you ask for a list of all comments associated to that calculation by typing:

.. code:: bash

    verdi node comment show <IDENTIFIER>

the comment that you just added will appear together with some useful information such as its creator and creation date.
We let you play with the other options of ``verdi node comment`` command to learn how to update or remove comments.

AiiDA groups of nodes
---------------------

In AiiDA, calculations (and more generally nodes) can be organized in groups, which are particularly useful to organise your data, and assign a set of calculations or data to a common subproject.
This allows you to have quick access to a whole set of calculations with no need for tedious browsing of the database or writing complex scripts for retrieving the desired nodes.
Type in the terminal:

.. code:: bash

    verdi group list -a -A

to show a list of all groups that exist in the database.
Choose the PK of the group named ``tutorial_pbesol`` and look at the calculations that it contains by typing:

.. code:: bash

    verdi group show <IDENTIFIER>

In this case, we have used the name of the group to organize calculations according to the pseudopotential that has been used to perform them.
Among the rows printed by the last command you will be able to find the calculation we have been inspecting until now.

If, instead, you want to know all the groups to which a specific node belongs, you can run:

.. code:: bash

    verdi group list -N/--node <IDENTIFIER>

Verdi shell and AiiDA objects
=============================

In this section we will use an interactive IPython environment with all the
basic AiiDA classes already loaded. We propose two realizations of such a
tool. The first consists of a special IPython shell where all the AiiDA
classes, methods and functions are accessible. Type in the terminal

.. code:: bash

    verdi shell

For all the everyday AiiDA-based operations, i.e. creating, querying, and
using AiiDA objects, the ``verdi shell`` is probably the best tool. In this
case, we suggest that you use two terminals, one for the ``verdi shell`` and
one to execute bash commands.

The second option is based on Jupyter notebooks and is probably most suitable
to the purposes of our tutorial. Go to the browser where you have opened
``jupyter`` and click ``New`` → ``Python 3`` (top right corner). This will
open an IPython-based Jupyter notebook, made of cells in which you can type
portions of python code. The code will not be executed until you press
``Shift+Enter`` from within a cell. Type in the first cell

.. code:: ipython

    %aiida

and execute it. This will set exactly the same environment as the
``verdi shell``. The notebook will be automatically saved upon any
modification. When you think you are done, you can export your notebook in
many formats by going to ``File`` → ``Download as``. We suggest you to have a
look at the drop-down menus ``Insert`` and ``Cell`` where you will find the
main commands to manage the cells of your notebook.

.. note::

    The ``verdi shell`` and Jupyter
    notebook are completely equivalent. Use the one you prefer.

You will still sometimes need to type command-line instructions in ``bash`` in
the first terminal you opened. To differentiate these from the commands to be
typed in the ``verdi shell``, the latter will be marked in this document by a
green background, like:

.. code:: python

    load_node(100) # A python verdi shell command

while command-line instructions in ``bash`` to be typed into a terminal will
be written with a blue background:

.. code:: bash

    verdi process list

Alternatively, to avoid changing terminal, you can execute ``bash`` commands
within the ``verdi shell`` or the notebook by adding an exclamation mark before
the command itself:

.. code:: ipython

    !verdi process list

.. _2020_virtual_loadnode:

Loading a node
--------------

Most AiiDA objects are represented by nodes, identified in the database by its
*PK* (an integer). You can access a node using the following command
in the shell:

.. code:: python

    node = load_node(PK)

Load a node using the *PK* of one of the calculations visible in the graph you displayed in the previous section of the tutorial.
Then get the energy of the calculation with the command:

.. code:: python

    node.res.energy

You can also type

.. code:: python

    node.res.

and then press ``TAB`` to see all the available output results of the calculation.

Loading specific kinds of nodes
-------------------------------

Pseudopotentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the graph you generated in  section :ref:`2020_virtual_aiidagraph`, find the UUID of the pseudopotential file (LDA).
Load it and show what elements it corresponds to by typing:

.. code:: python

    upf = load_node('<UUID>')
    upf.element

All methods of ``UpfData`` are accessible by typing ``upf.`` and then pressing ``TAB``.

k-points
~~~~~~~~

A set of k-points in the Brillouin zone is represented by an instance of the ``KpointsData`` class.
Choose one from the graph of produced in section :ref:`2020_virtual_aiidagraph`, load it as ``kpoints`` and inspect its content:

.. code:: python

    kpoints = load_node("<UUID>")
    kpoints.get_kpoints_mesh()

Then get the full (explicit) list of k-points belonging to this mesh using

.. code:: python

    kpoints.get_kpoints_mesh(print_list=True)

If this throws an ``AttributeError``, it means that the kpoints instance does not represent a regular mesh but rather a list of k-points defined by their crystal coordinates (typically used when plotting a band structure).
In this case, get the list of k-points coordinates using

.. code:: python

    kpoints.get_kpoints()

Conversely, if the ``KpointsData`` node `does` actually represent a mesh, this method is the one, that when called, will throw an ``AttributeError``.

If you prefer Cartesian (rather than crystal) coordinates, type

.. code:: python

    kpoints.get_kpoints(cartesian=True)

For later use in this tutorial, let us try now to create a kpoints instance, to describe a regular (2 x 2 x 2) mesh of k-points, centered at the Gamma point (i.e. without offset).
This can be done with the following commands:

.. code:: python

    KpointsData = DataFactory('array.kpoints')
    kpoints = KpointsData()
    kpoints_mesh = 2
    kpoints.set_kpoints_mesh([kpoints_mesh] * 3)
    kpoints.store()

This function loads the appropriate class defined in a string (here ``array.kpoints``).
Therefore, ``KpointsData`` is not a class instance, but the kpoints class itself!

While it is also possible to import ``KpointsData`` directly, it is recommended to use the ``DataFactory`` function instead, as this is more future-proof:
even if the import path of the class changes in the future, its entry point string (``array.kpoints``) will remain stable.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

Dictionaries with various parameters are represented in AiiDA by ``Dict`` nodes.
Get the UUID and load the input parameters of a calculation in the graph produced in section :ref:`2020_virtual_aiidagraph`.
Then display its content by typing

.. code:: python

    params = load_node('<UUID>')
    YOUR_DICT = params.get_dict()
    YOUR_DICT

Modify the python dictionary ``YOUR_DICT`` so that the wave-function cutoff is now set to 20 Ry.
Note that you cannot modify an object already stored in the database.
To write the modified dictionary to the database, create a new object of class ``Dict``:

.. code:: python

    Dict = DataFactory('dict')
    new_params = Dict(dict=YOUR_DICT)

where ``YOUR_DICT`` is the modified python dictionary.
Note that ``new_params`` is not yet stored in the database.
In fact, typing ``new_params`` in the verdi shell will print a string notifying you of its 'unstored' status.
Let's finish by storing the ``new_params`` dictionary node in the datbase:

.. code:: python

    new_params.store()

Structures
~~~~~~~~~~

Find a structure in the graph you generated in section :ref:`2020_virtual_aiidagraph` and load it.
Display its chemical formula, atomic positions and species using

.. code:: python

    structure.get_formula()
    structure.sites

where ``structure`` is the structure you loaded.
If you are familiar with `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__ and `Pymatgen <https://pymatgen.org/>`__, you can convert this structure to those formats by typing

.. code:: python

    structure.get_ase()
    structure.get_pymatgen()

Let’s try now to define a new structure to study, specifically a silicon crystal.
In the ``verdi shell``, define a cubic unit cell as a 3 x 3 matrix, with lattice parameter `a`\ :sub:`lat`\ `= 5.4` Å:

.. code:: python

    alat = 5.4
    the_cell = [[alat/2, alat/2, 0.], [alat/2, 0., alat/2], [0., alat/2, alat/2]]

.. note::

    Default units for crystal structure cell and coordinates in AiiDA are Å (Ångström).

Structures in AiiDA are instances of the class ``StructureData``: load it in the verdi shell

.. code:: python

    StructureData = DataFactory('structure')

Now, initialize the class instance (i.e. the actual structure we want to study) by the command

.. code:: python

    structure = StructureData(cell=the_cell)

which sets the cubic cell defined before.
From now on, you can access the cell with the command

.. code:: python

    structure.cell

Finally, append each of the 2 atoms of the cell command.
You can do it using commands like

.. code:: python

    structure.append_atom(position=(alat/4., alat/4., alat/4.), symbols="Si")

for the first ‘Si’ atom.
Repeat it for the other atomic site (0, 0, 0).
You can access and inspect the structure sites with the command

.. code:: python

    structure.sites

If you make a mistake, start over from
``structure = StructureData(cell=the_cell)``, or equivalently use ``structure.clear_kinds()`` to remove all kinds (atomic species) and sites.
Alternatively, AiiDA structures can also be converted directly from ASE structures [#f1]_ using

.. code:: python

    from ase.spacegroup import crystal
    ase_structure = crystal('Si', [(0, 0, 0)], spacegroup=227,
                 cellpar=[alat, alat, alat, 90, 90, 90], primitive_cell=True)
    structure = StructureData(ase=ase_structure)

Now you can store the new structure object in the database with the command:

.. code:: python

    structure.store()

Finally, a different way of creating the silicon structure is to import it from an external (online)
repository such as the `Crystallography Open Database (COD) <http://www.crystallography.net/cod/>`__:

.. code:: python

    from aiida.tools.dbimporters.plugins.cod import CodDbImporter
    importer = CodDbImporter()
    for entry in importer.query(formula='Si', spacegroup='F d -3 m'):
        structure = entry.get_aiida_structure()
        print("Formula:", structure.get_formula())
        print("Unit cell volume:", structure.get_cell_volume())
        print()

This will connect to the COD database on the web, perform the query for all entries with formula ``Si`` and spacegroup ``Fd-3m``, fetch the results and convert them to AiiDA StructureData objects.
In this case two structures exist for 'Si' in COD and both are shown.

Accessing inputs and outputs
----------------------------

Load again the calculation node used in the :ref:`2020_virtual_loadnode` section:

.. code:: python

    calc = load_node(PK)

Then type

.. code:: python

    calc.inputs.

and press ``TAB``:
you will see all the link names between the calculation and its input nodes.
You can use a specific linkname to access the corresponding input node, e.g.:

.. code:: python

    calc.inputs.structure

Similarly, if you type:

.. code:: python

    calc.outputs.

and then ``TAB``, you will list all output link names of the calculation.
One of them leads to the structure that was the input of ``calc`` we loaded previously:

.. code:: python

    calc.outputs.output_structure

Note that links have a single name, that was assigned by the calculation which used the corresponding input or produced the corresponding output, as illustrated in section :ref:`2020_virtual_aiidagraph`.

For a more programmatic approach, you can get a representation of the inputs and outputs of a node, say ``calc``, through the following methods:

.. code:: python

    calc_incoming = calc.get_incoming()
    calc_outgoing = calc.get_outgoing()

These methods will return an instance of the ``LinkManager`` class.
You can print all nodes calling the ``.all()`` method:

.. code:: python

    print(calc_incoming.all())

or you can just iterate over the neighboring nodes and check the link properties as follows:

.. code:: python

    for entry in calc.get_outgoing():
        print(entry.link_label, entry.link_type, entry.node)

each entry is a named tuple (called ``LinkTriple``), from which you can get the link label and type and the neighboring node itself.
If you print one, you will see something like:

.. code:: python

    LinkTriple(node=<Dict: uuid: fac99f59-c69e-4ccd-9655-c7da1d469145 (pk: 1050)>, link_type=<LinkType.CREATE: 'create'>, link_label=u'output_parameters')

There are many other convenience methods on the ``LinkManager``.
For example if you are only interested in the link labels you can use:

.. code:: python

    calc.get_outgoing().all_link_labels()

which will return a list of all the labels of the outgoing links.
Likewise, ``.all_nodes()`` will give you a list of all the nodes to which links are going out from the ``calc`` node.
If you are looking for the node with a specific label, you can use:

.. code:: python

    calc.get_outgoing().get_node_by_label('output_parameters')

The ``get_outgoing`` and ``get_incoming`` methods also support filtering on various properties, such as the link label.
For example, if you only want to get the outgoing links whose label starts with ``output``, you can do the following:

.. code:: python

    calc.get_outgoing(link_label_filter='output%').all()


Pseudopotential families
------------------------

Pseudopotentials in AiiDA are grouped in 'families' that contain one single pseudo per element.
We will see how to work with UPF pseudopotentials (the format used by Quantum ESPRESSO and some other codes).
Download and untar the SSSP pseudopotentials via the commands:

.. code:: bash

    mkdir sssp_pseudos
    wget 'https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/file?filename=SSSP_1.1_PBE_efficiency.tar.gz&record_id=23&file_id=d2ce4186-bf76-4e05-8b39-444b4da30273' -O SSSP_1.1_PBE_efficiency.tar.gz
    tar -C sssp_pseudos -zxvf SSSP_1.1_PBE_efficiency.tar.gz

Then you can upload the whole set of pseudopotentials to AiiDA by using the following ``verdi`` command:

.. code:: bash

    verdi data upf uploadfamily sssp_pseudos 'SSSP' 'SSSP pseudopotential library'

In the command above, ``sssp_pseudos`` is the folder containing the pseudopotentials, ``'SSSP'`` is the name given to the family, and the last argument is its description.
Finally, you can list all the pseudo families present in the database with

.. code:: bash

    verdi data upf listfamilies


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] We purposefully do not provide advanced commands for crystal structure manipulation in AiiDA, because python packages that accomplish such tasks already exist (such as ASE or pymatgen).
