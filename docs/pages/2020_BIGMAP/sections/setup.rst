As the first thing, open a terminal and type ``workon aiida`` to enter the "virtual environment" where AiiDA is installed.
You will know that you are in the virtual environment because each new line will start with ``(aiida)``, e.g.::

  (aiida) user@qe2019:~$

Note that you will need to retype ``workon aiida`` every time you open a new terminal.
