Quantum ESPRESSO
================

Now that we've covered the basics, let's continue with a quick demo of how AiiDA can make your life easier as a computational scientist.

Importing a structure and inspecting it
---------------------------------------

Let's download a structure from the `Crystallography Open Database <http://crystallography.net/cod/>`_ and import it into AiiDA.

.. note::

    You can also view the structure online `here <http://crystallography.net/cod/9008565.html>`_.

Download the file and import it with the following two commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ wget http://crystallography.net/cod/9008565.cif
    $ verdi data structure import ase 9008565.cif

Remember that each piece of data in AiiDA gets a PK number (a "primary key") that identifies it in your database.
This is printed out on the screen by the ``verdi data structure import`` command.
It's a good idea to mark it down, but should you forget, you can always have a look at the structures in the database using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi data structure list

.. important::

    Throughout the tutorial, remember to replace the string ``<PK>`` with the appropriate PK number.

Let us first inspect the node you just created:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi node show <PK>

You will get in output some information on the node, including its type (``StructureData``, the AiiDA data type for storing crystal structures), a label and a description (empty for now, can be changed), a creation time (``ctime``) and a last modification time (``mtime``), the PK of the node and its UUID (universally unique identifier).

``StructureData`` can be exported to file in various formats.
As an example, let's export the structure in XSF format and visualize it with XCrySDen:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi data structure export --format=xsf <PK> > exported.xsf
    $ xcrysden --xsf exported.xsf

You should be visualize to see the Si supercell (8 atoms) that we downloaded from the COD database (in CIF format), imported into AiiDA and exported back into a different format (XSF).

Running a calculation
---------------------

The following short python script sets up a self-consistent field calculation for the Quantum ESPRESSO code:

.. literalinclude:: include/snippets/demo_calcjob.py

Download the :download:`demo_calcjob.py <include/snippets/demo_calcjob.py>` script to your working directory.

**Exercise:** The ``demo_calcjob.py`` script contains a few placeholders for you to fill in:

    #. the VM already has a number of codes preconfigured. Use ``verdi code list`` to find the label for the `pw.x` code and replace ``<CODE LABEL>`` in the script.
    #. replace ``<STRUCTURE PK>`` with the PK of the structure you imported.
    #. the VM already contains a number of pseudopotential families. Replace ``<PP FAMILY>`` with the one for the "SSSP efficiency" library found via ``verdi data upf listfamilies``.

Finally, submit the calculation using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi run demo_calcjob.py

From this point onwards, the AiiDA daemon will take care of your calculation: creating the necessary input files, running the calculation, and parsing its results.

In order to be able to do this, the AiiDA daemon must of course be running: to check this, you can run the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi daemon status

and, if the daemon is not running, you can start it with

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi daemon start

It should take less than one minute to complete.

Analyzing the outputs of a calculation
--------------------------------------

Let's have a look how your calculation is doing:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi process list -a

Once again you can use the PK of the calculation to get more information on it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi process show <PK>
    Property     Value
    -----------  ------------------------------------
    type         PwCalculation
    state        Finished [0]
    pk           227
    uuid         65ad8ed4-3983-4700-8a5c-9dc191b0bee0

    computer     [1] localhost

    Inputs      PK    Type
    ----------  ----  -------------
    pseudos
        Si      95    UpfData
    code        3     Code
    kpoints     226   KpointsData
    parameters  225   Dict
    structure   208   StructureData

    Outputs              PK  Type
    -----------------  ----  --------------
    output_band         230  BandsData
    output_parameters   232  Dict
    output_trajectory   231  TrajectoryData
    remote_folder       228  RemoteData
    retrieved           229  FolderData

As you can see, AiiDA has tracked all the inputs provided to the calculation, allowing you (or anyone else) to reproduce it later on.
AiiDA's record of a calculation is best displayed in the form of a provenance graph:

.. figure:: include/images/demo_calc.png
    :width: 100%

    Provenance graph for a single Quantum ESPRESSO calculation.

Try to reproduce the figure using the PK of your calculation based on what you learned `in the basics section <BIGMAP_2020_Basics:calcfunction:graph>`_.

Let's have a look at one of the outputs: the ``output_parameters``.
You can get the contents of this dictionary easily using the ``verdi shell``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: node = load_node(232)

    In [2]: d = node.get_dict()

    In [3]: d['energy']
    Out[3]: -1242.9739990626

Moreover, you can also easily access the input and output files of the calculation using the ``verdi`` CLI:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi calcjob inputls <PK>     # Shows the list of input files
    $ verdi calcjob inputcat <PK>    # Shows the input file of the calculation
    $ verdi calcjob outputls <PK>    # Shows the list of output files
    $ verdi calcjob outputcat <PK>   # Shows the output file of the calculation
    $ verdi calcjob res <PK>         # Shows the parser results of the calculation

**Exercise:** A few questions you could answer using these commands (optional):

    * How many atoms did the structure contain? How many electrons?
    * How many k-points were specified? How many k-points were actually computed? Why?
    * How many SCF iterations were needed for convergence?
    * How long did Quantum ESPRESSO actually run (wall time)?

From calculations to workflows
------------------------------

AiiDA can help you run individual calculations but it is really designed to help you run workflows that involve several calculations, while automatically keeping track of the provenance for full reproducibility.

As the final step, we are going to launch the ``PwBandStructure`` workflow of the ``aiida-quantumespresso`` plugin.

.. literalinclude:: include/snippets/demo_bands.py

Download the :download:`demo_bands.py <include/snippets/demo_bands.py>` snippet and run it using

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi run demo_bands.py

This workflow will:

    #. Determine the primitive cell of the input structure
    #. Run a calculation on the primitive cell to relax both the cell and the atomic positions (``vc-relax``)
    #. Refine the symmetry of the relaxed structure, and find a standardised primitive cell using SeeK-path_
    #. Run a self-consistent field calculation on the refined structure
    #. Run a band structure calculation at fixed Kohn-Sham potential along a standard path between high-symmetry k-points determined by SeeK-path_

The workflow uses the PBE exchange-correlation functional with suitable pseudopotentials and energy cutoffs from the `SSSP library version 1.1 <https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/efficiency>`_.

.. _SeeK-path: https://www.materialscloud.org/work/tools/seekpath

.. K-point mesh is selected to have a minimum k-point density of 0.2 â„«-1
   A Marzari-Vanderbilt smearing of 0.02 Ry is used for the electronic occupations

The workflow should take ~10 minutes on your virtual machine.
You may notice that ``verdi process list`` now shows more than one entry.
While you wait for the workflow to complete, let's start exploring its provenance.

The full provenance graph obtained from ``verdi node graph generate`` will already be rather complex (you can try!), so let's try browsing the provenance interactively instead.

Start the AiiDA REST API:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi restapi

and open the |provenance browser| (from the browser inside the virtual machine).

.. |provenance browser| raw:: html

    <a href="https://www.materialscloud.org/explore/ownrestapi?base_url=http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v3" target="_blank">Materials Cloud provenance browser</a>

.. note::

    The provenance browser is a Javascript application that connects to the AiiDA REST API.
    Your data never leaves your computer.

.. some general comment on importance of the graph?
.. a sentence on how to continue from here

Browse your AiiDA database:

    * Start by finding your Quantum ESPRESSO calculation (the type of node is called a ``CalcJobNode`` in AiiDA, since it is run as a job on a scheduler).
    * Select ``Calculations`` in the left menu to filter for calculations only.
    * Inspect the raw inputs and outputs of the calculation, and use the provenance browser to explore the input and output nodes of the calculation and the whole provenance of your simulations.

.. note::

    When perfoming calculations for a publication, you can export your provenance graph using ``verdi export create`` and upload it to the `Materials Cloud Archive <https://archive.materialscloud.org/>`_, enabling your peers to explore the provenance of your calculations online.

Once the workchain is finished, use ``verdi process show <PK>`` to inspect the ``PwBandStructureWorkChain`` and find the PK of its ``band_structure`` output.
Use this to produce a PDF of the band structure:

.. code-block:: console

   $ verdi data bands export --format mpl_pdf --output band_structure.pdf <PK>

.. figure:: include/images/si_bands.png
   :width: 80%

   Band structure computed by the ``PwBandStructure`` workchain.

.. note::
   The ``BandsData`` node does contain information about the Fermi energy, so the energy zero in your plot will be arbitrary.
   You can produce a plot with the Fermi energy set to zero (as above) using the following code in a jupyter notebook:

   .. code-block:: ipython

        %matplotlib inline
        import aiida
        aiida.load_profile()

        from aiida.orm import load_node

        scf_params = load_node(<PK>)  # REPLACE with PK of "scf_parameters" output
        fermi_energy = scf_params.dict.fermi_energy

        bands = load_node(<PK>)  # REPLACE with PK of "band_structure" output
        bands.show_mpl(y_origin=fermi_energy, plot_zero_axis=True)

What next?
----------

You now have a first taste of the type of problems AiiDA tries to solve.
Here are some options for how to continue:

* Continue with the :ref:`in-depth tutorial<2020_Intro_Week_Homepage>`.
* Download the `Quantum Mobile`_ virtual machine and try running the tutorial on your laptop instead.
* Try `setting up AiiDA`_ directly on your laptop.
