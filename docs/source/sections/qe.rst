Quantum ESPRESSO
================

We'll start with a quick demo of how AiiDA can make your life easier as a computational scientist.

.. note::

  Throughout this tutorial we will be using the ``verdi`` command line interface (CLI).
  Here's couple of tricks that will make your life easier:

  * The ``verdi`` command supports **tab-completion**:
    In the terminal, type ``verdi``, followed by a space and press the 'Tab' key twice to show a list of all the available sub commands.
  * For help on ``verdi`` or any of its subcommands, simply append the ``--help/-h`` flag:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ verdi -h

Importing a structure and inspecting it
---------------------------------------

First, download the Si structure file: :download:`Si.cif <include/Si.cif>`.
You can download the file to the `AiiDAlab`_ cluster easily using ``wget``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ wget https://aiida-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/tutorial-2021-abc/_downloads/1383def58ffe702e2911585fea20e33d/Si.cif

Next, you can import it into your database with the ``verdi`` CLI.

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi data structure import ase Si.cif
      Successfully imported structure Si2 (PK = 1)

Each piece of data in AiiDA gets a PK number (a "primary key") that identifies it in your database.
This is printed out on the screen by the ``verdi data structure import`` command.
It's a good idea to mark it down, but should you forget, you can always have a look at the structures in the database using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi data structure list
      Id  Label    Formula
    ----  -------  ---------
       1           Si2

The first column (marked ``Id``) are the PK's of the ``StructureData`` nodes.

.. important::

    If you are starting this tutorial with an empty database, as in this example, the Si structure node PK will also be 1.
    If not, the PK numbers shown throughout this tutorial will be different for your database!
    Throughout this section, replace the string ``<PK>`` with the appropriate PK number.

Let us first inspect the node you just created:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi node show 1
    Property     Value
    -----------  ------------------------------------
    type         StructureData
    pk           1
    uuid         ddb8c21c-2d3f-4374-aa86-44f8bb84aa3f
    label
    description
    ctime        2021-02-09 20:57:03.304174+00:00
    mtime        2021-02-09 20:57:03.421210+00:00

You can see some information on the node, including its type (``StructureData``, the AiiDA data type for storing crystal structures), a label and a description (empty for now, can be changed), a creation time (``ctime``) and a last modification time (``mtime``), the PK of the node and its UUID (universally unique identifier).
The PK and UUID both reference the node with the only difference that the PK is unique *for your local database only*, whereas the UUID is a globally unique identifier and can therefore be used between *different* databases.

.. important::

    The UUIDs are generated randomly and are therefore **guaranteed** to be different from the ones shown here.
    In the commands that follow, remember to replace ``<PK>``, or ``<UUID>`` by the appropriate identifier.

Running a calculation
---------------------

We'll start with running a simple self-consistent field calculation (SCF) with `Quantum ESPRESSO`_ for the structure we just imported.
First, we'll have to set up the `Quantum ESPRESSO`_ code in our database.
This can be done with the following ``verdi`` CLI command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi code setup --label pw --computer localhost --remote-abs-path /usr/bin/pw.x --input-plugin quantumespresso.pw --non-interactive
    Success: Code<2> pw@localhost created

Let's now look at the codes in our database with the ``verdi shell``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi code list
    # List of configured codes:
    # (use 'verdi code show CODEID' to see the details)
    * pk 2 - pw@localhost

We can see the code you just set up, with label ``pw``, set up on the ``localhost`` computer.

To run the SCF calculation, we'll also need to provide the family of pseudopotentials.
These can be installed easily using the ``aiida-pseudo`` package:

.. code-block:: console

    $ aiida-pseudo install sssp
    Info: downloading selected pseudo potentials archive...  [OK]
    Info: downloading selected pseudo potentials metadata...  [OK]
    Info: unpacking archive and parsing pseudos...  [OK]
    Success: installed `SSSP/1.1/PBE/efficiency` containing 85 pseudo potentials

This command will install the `SSSP library version 1.1`_.
To see if the pseudopotential families have been installed correctly, do:

.. code-block:: console

    $ aiida-pseudo list
    Label                    Type string         Count
    -----------------------  ------------------  -------
    SSSP/1.1/PBE/efficiency  pseudo.family.sssp  85

Along with the PK of the ``StructureData`` node for the silicon structure that we imported in the previous section, we now have everything to set up the calculation step by step.
Before doing so we will first shut down the AiiDA *daemon*.
The daemon is a program that runs in the background and manages submitted calculations until they are *terminated*.
Check the status of the daemon using the ``verdi`` CLI:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi daemon status

If the daemon is running, the output will be something like the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    Profile: default
    Daemon is running as PID 1033 since 2020-11-29 14:37:59
    Active workers [1]:
    PID    MEM %    CPU %  started
    -----  -------  -------  -------------------
    1036    0.415        0  2020-11-29 14:38:00

In this case, let's stop it for now:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi daemon stop
    Profile: default
    Waiting for the daemon to shut down... OK

We will set up the calculation in the ``verdi shell``, an interactive IPython shell that has many basic AiiDA classes pre-loaded.
To start the IPython shell, simply type in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi shell

First, we'll load the code from the database using its label:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: code = load_code(label='pw')

Every code has a convenient tool for setting up the required input, called the *builder*.
It can be obtained by using the ``get_builder`` method:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [2]: builder = code.get_builder()

Let's supply the builder with the structure we just imported.
Replace the ``<STRUCTURE_PK>`` with that of the structure we imported at the start of the section:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: structure = load_node(<STRUCTURE_PK>)
       ...: builder.structure = structure

.. note::

    One nifty feature of the builder is the ability to use tab completion for the inputs.
    Try it out by typing ``builder.`` + ``<TAB>`` in the verdi shell.

You can get more information on an input by adding a question mark ``?``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [4]: builder.structure?
    Type:        property
    String form: <property object at 0x7f3393e81050>
    Docstring:   {"name": "structure", "required": "True", "valid_type": "<class 'aiida.orm.nodes.data.structure.StructureData'>", "help": "The input structure.", "non_db": "False"}

Here you can see that the ``structure`` input is required, needs to be of the ``StructureData`` type and is stored in the database (``"non_db": "False"``).

Next, we'll need a dictionary that maps the elements to the pseudopotentials we want to use.
Let's first load the pseudopotential family we installed before with ``aiida-pseudo``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [5]: pseudo_family = load_group('SSSP/1.1/PBE/efficiency')

.. note::

    Notice how we use the ``load_group`` command here.
    An AiiDA ``Group`` is a convenient way of organizing your data.
    We'll see more on how to use groups in the section on :ref:`Working with data <data>`.

The required pseudos for any structure can be easily obtained using the ``get_pseudos()`` method of the ``pseudo_family``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [6]: pseudos = pseudo_family.get_pseudos(structure=structure)

If we check the contents of the ``pseudos`` variable:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [6]: pseudos
    Out[6]: {'Si': <UpfData: uuid: afa12680-efd3-4e9a-b4a7-b7a69ee2da51 (pk: 69)>}

We can see that it is a simple dictionary that maps the ``'Si'`` element to a ``UpfData`` node, which contains the pseudopotential for silicon in the database.
Let's pass the ``pseudos`` to the builder:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [7]: builder.pseudos = pseudos

Of course, we also have to set some computational parameters.
We'll first set up a dictionary with a simple set of input parameters for Quantum ESPRESSO:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [8]: parameters = {
       ...:   'CONTROL': {
       ...:     'calculation': 'scf',  # self-consistent field
       ...:   },
       ...:   'SYSTEM': {
       ...:     'ecutwfc': 30.,  # wave function cutoff in Ry
       ...:     'ecutrho': 240.,  # density cutoff in Ry
       ...:   },
       ...: }

In order to store them in the database, they **must** be passed to the builder as a ``Dict`` node:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [9]: builder.parameters = Dict(dict=parameters)

The k-points mesh can be supplied via a ``KpointsData`` node.
Load the corresponding class using the ``DataFactory``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [10]: KpointsData = DataFactory('array.kpoints')

The ``DataFactory`` is a useful and robust tool for loading data types based on their *entry point*, e.g. ``'array.kpoints'`` in this case.
Once the class is loaded, defining the k-points mesh and passing it to the builder is easy:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [11]: kpoints = KpointsData()
        ...: kpoints.set_kpoints_mesh([4,4,4])
        ...: builder.kpoints = kpoints

Finally, we can also specify the resources we want to use for our calculation.
These are stored in the *metadata*:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: builder.metadata.options.resources = {'num_machines': 1}

Great, we're all set!
Now all that is left to do is to *submit* the builder to the daemon.

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [13]: from aiida.engine import submit
        ...: calcjob_node = submit(builder)

Let's exit the ``verdi shell`` using the ``exit()`` command and check the list of processes stored in your database with ``verdi process list``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi process list
      PK  Created    Process label    Process State    Process status
    ----  ---------  ---------------  ---------------  ----------------
      90  36s ago    PwCalculation    ⏹ Created

    Total results: 1

    Info: last time an entry changed state: 36s ago (at 23:14:25 on 2021-02-09)
    Warning: the daemon is not running

We can see the ``PwCalculation`` we have just set up, i.e. the process that runs a Quantum ESPRESSO ``pw.x`` calculation.
It's currently in the ``Created`` state.
In order to run the calculation, we have to start the daemon:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi daemon start

From this point onwards, the AiiDA daemon will take care of your calculation: creating the necessary input files, running the calculation, and parsing its results.
The calculation should take less than one minute to complete.

Analyzing the outputs of a calculation
--------------------------------------

Let's have a look how your calculation is doing!
By default ``verdi process list`` only shows the *active* processes.
To see *all* processes, use the ``--all`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi process list --all
      PK  Created    Process label    Process State    Process status
    ----  ---------  ---------------  ---------------  ----------------
      90  8m ago     PwCalculation    ⏹ Finished [0]

    Total results: 1

    Info: last time an entry changed state: 22s ago (at 23:22:07 on 2021-02-09)

Use the PK of the ``PwCalculation`` to get more information on it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi process show <PK>
    Property     Value
    -----------  ------------------------------------
    type         PwCalculation
    state        Finished [0]
    pk           90
    uuid         85e38ed3-bb42-4a4b-bd28-d8031736193e
    label
    description
    ctime        2021-02-09 23:14:24.899458+00:00
    mtime        2021-02-09 23:22:07.100611+00:00

    Inputs      PK    Type
    ----------  ----  -------------
    pseudos
        Si      69    UpfData
    code        2     Code
    kpoints     89    KpointsData
    parameters  88    Dict
    structure   1     StructureData

    Outputs              PK  Type
    -----------------  ----  --------------
    output_band          93  BandsData
    output_parameters    95  Dict
    output_trajectory    94  TrajectoryData
    remote_folder        91  RemoteData
    retrieved            92  FolderData

As you can see, AiiDA has tracked all the inputs provided to the calculation, allowing you (or anyone else) to reproduce it later on.
AiiDA's record of a calculation is best displayed in the form of a provenance graph:

.. figure:: include/images/demo_calc.png
    :width: 100%

    Provenance graph for a single `Quantum ESPRESSO`_ calculation.

To reproduce the figure using the PK of your calculation, you can use the following verdi command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ verdi node graph generate <PK>

The command will write the provenance graph to a ``.pdf`` file.
If you open a *file manager* on the start page of the AiiDA JupyterHub, you should be able to navigate to and open the PDF.

Let's have a look at one of the outputs, i.e. the ``output_parameters``.
You can get the contents of this dictionary easily using the ``verdi shell``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: node = load_node(<PK>)
       ...: d = node.get_dict()
       ...: d['energy']
    Out[1]: -310.56885928359

Moreover, you can also easily access the input and output files of the calculation using the ``verdi`` CLI:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi calcjob inputls <PK>     # Shows the list of input files
    $ verdi calcjob inputcat <PK>    # Shows the input file of the calculation
    $ verdi calcjob outputls <PK>    # Shows the list of output files
    $ verdi calcjob outputcat <PK>   # Shows the output file of the calculation
    $ verdi calcjob res <PK>         # Shows the parser results of the calculation

**Exercise:** A few questions you could answer using these commands (optional):

    * How many atoms did the structure contain? How many electrons?
    * How many k-points were specified? How many k-points were actually computed? Why?
    * How many SCF iterations were needed for convergence?
    * How long did `Quantum ESPRESSO`_ actually run (wall time)?


.. _quantum_espresso_intro:workflows:

From calculations to workflows
------------------------------

AiiDA can help you run individual calculations but it is really designed to help you run workflows that involve several calculations, while automatically keeping track of the provenance for full reproducibility.

To see all currently available workflows in your installation, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi plugin list aiida.workflows

We are going to run the ``PwBandsWorkChain`` workflow of the ``aiida-quantumespresso`` plugin.
You can see it on the list as ``quantumespresso.pw.bands``, which is the *entry point* of this work chain.
This is a fully automated workflow that will:

    #. Run a calculation on the cell to relax both the cell and the atomic positions (``vc-relax``).
    #. Refine the symmetry of the relaxed structure, and find a standardized cell using SeeK-path_.
    #. Run a self-consistent field calculation on the refined structure.
    #. Run a band structure calculation at a fixed Kohn-Sham potential along a standard path between high-symmetry k-points determined by SeeK-path_.

In order to run it, we will again open the ``verdi shell``.
We will then load the work chain using its entry point and the ``WorkflowFactory``:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: PwBandsWorkChain = WorkflowFactory('quantumespresso.pw.bands')

Setting up the inputs one by one as we did for the pw.x calculation in the previous section can be quite tedious.
Instead, we are going to use one of the protocols that has been set up for the workflow.
To do this, all we need to provide is the code and initial structure we are going to run:

.. code-block::

    In [2]: code = load_code(label='pw')
       ...: structure = load_node(<STRUCTURE_PK>)

Be sure to replace the ``<STRUCTURE_PK>`` with that of the structure we used in the first section.
Next, we use the ``get_builder_from_protocol()`` method to obtain a prepopulated builder for the workflow:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: builder = PwBandsWorkChain.get_builder_from_protocol(code=code, structure=structure)

The default protocol uses the PBE exchange-correlation functional with suitable pseudopotentials and energy cutoffs from the `SSSP library version 1.1`_ we installed earlier.
Finally, we just need to submit the builder in the same way as we did for the calculation:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [4]: from aiida.engine import submit
       ...: workchain_node = submit(builder)

And done!
Just like that, we have prepared and submitted an automated process to obtain the band structure of silicon.
If you want to check the status of the calculation, you can exit the ``verdi shell`` and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi process list
      PK  Created    Process label     Process State    Process status
    ----  ---------  ----------------  ---------------  ---------------------------------------
     113  19s ago    PwBandsWorkChain  ⏵ Waiting        Waiting for child processes: 115
     115  15s ago    PwRelaxWorkChain  ⏵ Waiting        Waiting for child processes: 118
     118  13s ago    PwBaseWorkChain   ⏵ Waiting        Waiting for child processes: 123
     123  11s ago    PwCalculation     ⏵ Waiting        Monitoring scheduler: job state RUNNING

    Total results: 4

    Info: last time an entry changed state: 8s ago (at 23:32:21 on 2021-02-09)

You may notice that ``verdi process list`` now shows more than one entry: indeed, there are a couple of calculations and sub-workflows that need to be run.
The total workflow should take about 5 minutes to finish on the `AiiDAlab`_ cluster.

While we wait for the workflow to complete, we can start learning about how to explore the provenance of an AiiDA database.

Exploring the database
----------------------

In most cases, the full provenance graph obtained from ``verdi node graph generate`` will be rather complex to follow.
To see this for yourself, you can try to generate the one for the work chains ran by the `Quantum ESPRESSO`_ app, or for the work chain script of the last section.
It therefore becomes very useful to learn how to browse the provenance interactively instead.

To do so, we will use the AiiDA REST API, which is a web-based interface for us to communicate with AiiDA.
Let's start the AiiDA REST API:

.. code-block:: console

  $ verdi restapi

If you were working on your local machine, you would be automatically be able to access your exposed data via ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v4`` (this would also work from inside a virtual machine).
Since these virtual machines are remote and we need to access the information locally in your workstation, we will need an extra step.
Open a new terminal from the start page and run `ngrok`_, a tool that allows us to expose the REST API to a public URL:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ngrok http 5000 --region eu --bind-tls true


Now you will be able to open the |provenance browser| and enter the public URL that ``ngrok`` is using, i.e. if the following is the output in your terminal:

.. |provenance browser| raw:: html

    <a href="https://www.materialscloud.org/explore/connect" target="_blank">Materials Cloud Explore section</a>


.. code-block:: console

    ngrok by @inconshreveable                                                                                  (Ctrl+C to quit)

    Session Status                online
    Session Expires               7 hours, 52 minutes
    Version                       2.3.35
    Region                        Europe (eu)
    Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
    Forwarding                    https://bb84d27809e0.eu.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000


then the URL you should provide the provenance browser is ``https://bb84d27809e0.eu.ngrok.io/api/v4`` (see the last ``Forwarding`` line).

.. note::

    The provenance browser is a Javascript application that connects to the AiiDA REST API.
    Your data never leaves your computer.

.. note::

    In the following section, we will show an example of how to browse your database using the `Materials Cloud explore <https://www.materialscloud.org/explore/menu>`_ interface.
    Since this interface is highly dependent on the particulars of your own database, you will most likely don't have the exact nodes or structures we are showing in the example.
    The instructions below serve more as a general guideline on how to interact with the interface in order to do the final exercise.

For a quick example on how to browse the database, you can do the following.
First, notice the content of the main page in the `grid` view: all your nodes are listed in the center, while the lateral bar offers the option of filtering according to node type.

   .. figure:: include/screenshots/explore_00.png
     :width: 100%

     Main page of the `grid` view.

Now we are going to look at the available band structure nodes, for which we will need to expand the `Array` lateral section and click on the `BandsData` subsection:

   .. figure:: include/screenshots/explore_01.png
     :width: 100%

     All nodes of type ``BandsData``, listed in the `grid` view.

Here we can just select one of the available nodes and click on `details` on the right.
This will take us to the `details` view of that particular node:

   .. figure:: include/screenshots/explore_02.png
     :width: 100%

     The `details` view of a specific node of type ``BandsData``.


We can see that the Explore Section can visualize the band structure stored in a ``BandsData`` node.
It also shows (as it does for all types of nodes) the `AiiDA Provenance Browser` on its right.
This tool allows us to easily explore the connections between nodes and understand, for example, how these results were obtained.
For example, go to the ``CalcJob`` node that produced the band structure by finding the red square with the incoming link labeled ``output_band`` and clicking on it.
This will redirect us to the `details` page for that ``CalcJob`` node:

   .. figure:: include/screenshots/explore_03.png
     :width: 100%

     The `details` view of the ``CalcJob`` node that created the original ``BandsData`` node.

You can check out here the details of the calculation, such as the input and output files, the `Node metadata` and `Job information` dropdown menus, etc.
You may also want to know for which crystal structure the band structure was calculated.
Although this information can also be found inside the input files, we will look for it directly in the input nodes, again by using the `AiiDA Provenance Browser`.
This time we will look for the ``StructureData`` node (green circle) that has an outgoing link (so, the arrow points from the ``data`` node to the central current ``process`` node) with the label `structure` and click on it:

   .. figure:: include/screenshots/explore_04.png
     :width: 100%

     The `details` view of the ``StructureData`` node that corresponds to the original ``BandsData`` node.

We can see in this particular case that the original ``BandsData`` corresponds to a Silica structure (your final structure might be different).
You can look at the structure here, explore the details of the cell, etc.

**Exercise:**
By now it is likely that your workflow has finished running.
Repeat the same procedure described above to find the structure used to calculate the resulting band structure.
You can identify this band structure easily as it will be the one with the newest creation time.
Once you do:

    1. Go to the `details` view for that ``BandsData`` node.
    2. Look in the provenance browser for the calculation that created these bands and click on it.
    3. Verify that this calculation is of type ``PwCalculation`` (look for the ``process_label`` in the `node metadata` subsection).
    4. Look in the provenance browser for the ``StructureData`` that was used as input for this calculation.

As you can see, the explore tool of the `Materials Cloud <https://www.materialscloud.org/explore/menu>`_ offers a very natural and intuitive interface to use for a light exploration of a database.
However, you might already imagine that doing a more intensive kind of data mining of specific results this way can quickly become tedious.
For this use cases, AiiDA has a more versatile tool: the ``QueryBuilder``.
This will be discussed in the section on :ref:`Working with data <data>`.

Finishing the work chain
------------------------

Let's stop ``ngrok`` using ``Ctrl+C`` and close its terminal, as well as stop the REST API (also using ``Ctrl+C``).
Use ``verdi process show <PK>`` to inspect the ``PwBandsWorkChain`` and find the PK of its ``band_structure`` output.
Instead of relying on the explore tool, we can also plot the band structure using the ``verdi shell``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ verdi data bands export --format mpl_pdf --output band_structure.pdf <PK>

Use the JupyterHub file manager to open the ``band_structure.pdf`` file.

.. figure:: include/images/si_bands.png
   :width: 100%

   Band structure computed by the ``PwBandsWorkChain``.

Finally, the ``verdi process status`` command prints a *hierarchical* overview of the processes called by the work chain:

.. code-block:: console

    $ verdi process status <PK>
    PwBandsWorkChain<113> Finished [0] [7:results]
        ├── PwRelaxWorkChain<115> Finished [0] [3:results]
        │   ├── PwBaseWorkChain<118> Finished [0] [7:results]
        │   │   ├── create_kpoints_from_distance<119> Finished [0]
        │   │   └── PwCalculation<123> Finished [0]
        │   └── PwBaseWorkChain<132> Finished [0] [7:results]
        │       ├── create_kpoints_from_distance<133> Finished [0]
        │       └── PwCalculation<137> Finished [0]
        ├── seekpath_structure_analysis<144> Finished [0]
        ├── PwBaseWorkChain<151> Finished [0] [7:results]
        │   ├── create_kpoints_from_distance<152> Finished [0]
        │   └── PwCalculation<156> Finished [0]
        └── PwBaseWorkChain<164> Finished [0] [7:results]
            └── PwCalculation<167> Finished [0]

The bracket ``[7:result]`` indicates the current step in the outline of the ``PwBandsWorkChain`` (step 7, with name ``result``).
The ``process status`` is particularly useful for debugging complex work chains, since it helps pinpoint where a problem occurred.

Congratulations on finishing the first part of the tutorial!
In the next section, we'll look at how to organize and query your data.
