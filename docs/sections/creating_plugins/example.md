# Interfacing with external codes - Example

**Task:** Follow the instructions on [writing a plugin for an external code](<https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v2.0.3/howto/plugin_codes.html>).

**Result:** You will write a Python script with your first `CalcJob` and `Parser` plugin, telling AiiDA how to write inputs and parse outputs for a simple external executable.

**Time:** This should be easily doable in the available 1.5h.
