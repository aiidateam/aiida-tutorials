# Template your own plugin package

**Task:** Template your own plugin package using the [AiiDA plugin cutter](<https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-plugin-cutter>) and start wrapping your code.

**Result:** An AiiDA plugin package, prepared for distribution via PyPI, and including templates for continuous integration tests and documentation.

**Time:** Don't expect to have a fully fledged plugin ready by the end of the session!
This is is an open-ended task aimed at getting you through initial hurdles more quickly by having AiiDA developers around to ask for help.
