# Troubleshooting

In this section we will intentionally introduce some bad input parameters when setting up our calculation.
This will allow us to illustrate how to 'manually' debug problems that might arise while managing your computations with AiiDA.
You will learn where to look for the information of the errors and the steps you need to take to correct the issue.
In other tutorial sections you can then learn how to systematize this error handling when designing complex workflows.

:::{attention}

In the next subsection, you will need to set up a `calcjob` and then `run`/`submit` it to explore its results.
You will have to do some parts of this procedure on your own, including the creation/manipulation of `StructureData`, `UpfData` ([pseudopotentials](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopotential>)), and `KpointsData` nodes.

Moreover, you are assumed to already have installed and configured a `pw.x` code from Quantum ESPRESSO and its corresponding AiiDA plugin (`aiida-quantumespresso`).

If you are not sure how to do this, please review the following tutorial section on {ref}`running computations<calculations-basics>` and use it as a reference.

:::

## Calculation setup

The first step for this will be to set up a calculation for the `pw.x` code of the Quantum ESPRESSO package.
We will do so by loading and configuring the builder for the corresponding plugin (`quantumespresso.pw`).
Remember that you can run `verdi code list` to check what codes you have available and their information.

```{code-block} ipython

In [1]: code_pw = load_code(<CODE_PK>)
   ...: builder = code_pw.get_builder()

```

You will need to set the rest of the inputs by yourself, the most critical being the following:

```{code-block} ipython

In [2]: builder.structure = ...
   ...: builder.kpoints = ...
   ...: builder.pseudos = ...
   ...: builder.metadata.options.resources = {'num_machines': 1}

```

For the `structure` you can download the following {download}`silicon crystal<include/data/Si.cif>` and import it into your database.
If you have already loaded this structure in your database (as it is used in other tutorial modules), you may want to use that pre-existing node instead of saving a new node with repeated information.
To do so you may search for its pk by running `verdi data structure list` and then use the python function `load_node()` to retrieve it into a variable.

For the `pseudos` (or [pseudopotentials](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopotential>)), you can use the `SSSP/1.1/PBE/efficiency` family of the `aiida-pseudo` package.
If you already have it installed, it is enough to use the `load_group` function and then the `get_pseudos` method of the pseudo group.

The set of `kpoints` can be simply created by using the `KpointsData` plugin methods to define a `2x2x2` mesh and store it in a new node.
The `resources` provided above will work for a locally hosted code (which should be the case for these tutorial modules), but if you are running these tests in a cluster, you may need to set up account permissions or other options.

Finally, we need to specify the input parameters, for which we'll use the following content:

```{code-block} ipython

In [3]: parameters_dict = {
   ...:     'CONTROL': {
   ...:         'calculation': 'scf',
   ...:     },
   ...:     'SYSTEM': {
   ...:         'ecutwfc': 30.,
   ...:         'ecutrho': 200.,
   ...:         'mickeymouse': 240.,
   ...:     },
   ...:     'ELECTRONS': {
   ...:         'conv_thr': 1.e-14,
   ...:         'electron_maxstep': 3,
   ...:     },
   ...: }

```

This dictionary is almost a valid input for Quantum ESPRESSO, except for an invalid key `mickeymouse`.
By default, the AiiDA plugin will simply pass your input to the code *without* doing any validation, but when Quantum ESPRESSO receives the unrecognized keyword it will stop.

We have also introduced a combination of a very high accuracy (`'conv_thr': 1.e-14`) coupled with a very low maximum number of self consistent iterations (`'electron_maxstep': 3`).
This means that even if we eliminate the invalid key, the calculation will not converge and will not be successful, despite there not being any other mistake in the parameters dictionary.

Let's wrap the `parameters_dict` python dictionary in an AiiDA `Dict` node, and set it as the input of name `parameters`. We'll see what happens .

```{code-block} ipython

In [4]: builder.parameters = Dict(dict=parameters_dict)

```

## Simulating submissions

In order to check which input files AiiDA creates, we can perform a *dry run* of the submission process.
Let's tell the builder that we want a dry run and that we don't want to store the provenance of the dry run:

```{code-block} ipython

In [5]: builder.metadata.dry_run = True
   ...: builder.metadata.store_provenance = False

```

It's time to run:

```{code-block} ipython

In [6]: from aiida.engine import run
   ...: run(builder)

```

This creates a folder of the form `submit_test/[date]-0000[x]` in the current directory.
Open a second terminal and:

* open the input file `aiida.in` within this folder
* compare it to input data nodes you created earlier
* verify that the `pseudo` folder contains the needed pseudopotentials
* have a look at the submission script `_aiidasubmit.sh`

:::{note}

The files created by a dry run are only intended for inspection and there is no point in applying any correction to them directly.
AiiDA will re-create the input files from the input nodes at the time of any subsequent submission, so you have to make sure that those input nodes have the correct content.

:::

## Troubleshooting calculations

Now that we have inspected the input files and convinced ourselves that Quantum ESPRESSO will have all the information it needs, let's revert the following values in our builder to their defaults:

```{code-block} ipython

In [7]: builder.metadata.dry_run = False
   ...: builder.metadata.store_provenance = True

```

And submit the calculation properly:

```{code-block} ipython

In [8]: from aiida.engine import submit
   ...: calculation = submit(builder)

```

You can now check the calculation status from the command line:

```{code-block} console

$ verdi process list -a -p1
  PK  Created    Process label    Process State     Process status
----  ---------  ---------------  ----------------  ----------------
2060  5m ago     PwCalculation    ‚èπ Finished [305]
...
# Anything but [0] after the Finished state signals a failure

```

Your calculation should end up in a finished state, but with some error: this was expected in this case, since we used an invalid key in the input parameters.
You will see this represented by a non-zero error code in brackets near the "Finished" status of the State.

:::{note}

If the daemon is not running, the calculation will remain in the `NEW` state until you start it by executing `verdi daemon start` in the command line.

:::

Situations like this happen frequently in real life, so AiiDA provides tools to help you trace back to the source of the problem and correct it.


### Checking the logs

First start by using `verdi process show` to display a more detailed summary of the process:

```{code-block} console

$ verdi process show <pk_number>
Property     Value
-----------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
type         PwCalculation

Log messages
---------------------------------------------
There are 4 log messages for this calculation
Run 'verdi process report 2060' to see them

```

The last part of the output alerts you to the fact that there are some log messages waiting for you, if you run `verdi process report <pk>`.

If you read the report, you will see that it says that the output files could not be parsed.
In this case you can also try inspecting directly the output file of PWscf.

```{code-block} console

$ verdi calcjob outputcat <pk_number> | less

```

You will see an error message complaining about the `mickeymouse` line in the input.

### Checking the inputs

To verify and/or further investigate any information gathered by looking at the logs and outputs, it is sometimes convenient to take a look at the inputs used.
Similar to when we tried the dry run, we can also inspect the input files that AiiDA made to run the *actual* calculation.
We can first check the content of the calculation folder by running:

```{code-block} console

$ verdi calcjob inputls <pk_number> -c

```

where the `pk_number` corresponds to the one of your calculation.
This will list the files and subfolders inside of the input directory (`-c` prints folders in color).
You can also check the content of the input file with:

```{code-block} console

$ verdi calcjob inputcat <pk_number> | less

```

Again we see that, in effect, the `mickeymouse` keyword is effectively being used inside of the input file.
Having verified this in mutiple ways, let's now correct our input parameters dictionary by leaving out the invalid key and see if our calculation succeeds:

```{code-block} ipython

In [9]: parameters_dict = {
   ...:    "CONTROL": {
   ...:        "calculation": "scf",
   ...:    },
   ...:    "SYSTEM": {
   ...:        "ecutwfc": 30.,
   ...:        "ecutrho": 200.,
   ...:    },
   ...:    "ELECTRONS": {
   ...:        "conv_thr": 1.e-14,
   ...:        'electron_maxstep': 3,
   ...:    }
   ...: }
   ...: builder.parameters = Dict(dict=parameters_dict)
   ...: calculation = submit(builder)

```

Use `verdi process list -a -p1` to verify that the error code is different now.
You can check again the outputs and the reports with the tools explained in this section and try to fix it yourself before going on to the next.


## Restarting calculations

It turns out that your last calculation did not converge because we stopped the self-consistency iteration cycle before it converged (by only setting a max of 3 cycles).
In this simple case, you could just re-run the calculation from scratch with a sufficient number of iterations, but for expensive calculations (including a structural relaxation or molecular dynamics), you would like instead to restart your calculation from the previous one to save time.

For this purpose, `CalcJobNode` provides the `get_builder_restart` method.
Just like the `get_builder` method of the `Code` or of the `Process` class, this creates an instance of the `ProcessBuilder`, but with all inputs already pre-populated from those of the "parent" node.

Let us load the node of the calculation job that we want to restart in a `verdi shell` and create a new builder from it:

```{code-block} ipython

In [10]: failed_calculation = load_node(<PK>)
    ...: restart_builder = failed_calculation.get_builder_restart()

```

Type `restart_builder` and press Enter to verify that all inputs have already been set to those that were used for the original calculation.
Let's give the new calculation some more steps in the SCF cycle in order to let it converge:

```{code-block} ipython

In [11]: parameters = restart_builder.parameters.get_dict()
    ...: parameters['ELECTRONS']['electron_maxstep'] = 80

```

The `aiida-quantumespresso` plugin supports restarting a calculation by setting the corresponding `restart_mode` and attaching the remote working directory of the previous calculations as the `parent_folder` input [^f1]:

```{code-block} ipython

In [12]: parameters['CONTROL']['restart_mode'] = 'restart'
    ...: restart_builder.parent_folder = failed_calculation.outputs.remote_folder
    ...: restart_builder.parameters = Dict(dict=parameters)

```

Note that we've created a new `Dict` node for the modifed parameters since the original input is already stored in the database and is therefore immutable.

Finally, let's label this calculation as a restarted one and submit the new calculation:

```{code-block} ipython

In [13]: from aiida.engine import submit
    ...: restart_builder.metadata.label = 'Restart from PwCalculation<{}>'.format(failed_calculation.pk)
    ...: calculation = submit(restart_builder)

```

Inspect the restarted calculation to verify that, this time, it completes successfully.
You should see a "finished" status with exit code zero when running `verdi process list -a -p1`.

[^f1]: The `parent_folder` input for reusing the remote working folder of a previous calculation is specific to the `aiida-quantumespresso` plugin, but similar patterns are used in other plugins.
  The `PwCalculation` `CalcJob` plugin will copy the `outdir` of the parent simulation into the appropriate location, where Quantum ESPRESSO's `pw.x` executable looks for wavefunctions, charge densities, etc.
  This allows to keep the checkpoint files (which may be large) on the remote machine, while still recording the provenance of the new calculation in the AiiDA graph as: `parent_calculation --> remote_folder --> restart_calculation`.
