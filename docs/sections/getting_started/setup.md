# Set up

## Set up AiiDA on your own machine

To run the tutorial material on your own machine, you need to install:

- [AiiDA](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/intro/get_started.html) (version 2.0.4)
- [aiida-quantumespresso](https://aiida-quantumespresso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html) (version 4.0.1)
- [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) (version 7.0)

```{note} Version numbers indicate the versions with which the tutorial was tested.
```

## Using Quantum Mobile

The tutorial can be run in the Quantum Mobile virtual machine.
Simply:

1. Download the tutorial image via [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xaZ4AZuyXoJ-sLKkaZpJQwvmWpkiykMq/view?usp=sharing).
2. Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 6.1.6 or later.
3. Import the virtual machine image into Virtualbox: `File => Import Appliance`

## Using AiiDAlab Launch

AiiDAlab Launch makes it easy to run AiiDA on your own workstation or laptop.

To use AiiDAlab launch you will have to

1. [Install Docker on your workstation or laptop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
2. Install AiiDAlab launch with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/) (**recommended**):

   ```console
   pipx install aiidalab-launch
   ```

   _Or directly with pip (`pip install aiidalab-launch`)._

3. Create a profile for tutorial

    ```console
    aiidalab-launch profiles add tutorial
    ```

    It will ask you to edit the profile, since for the tutorial we only need the AiiDA environment, answer `Y` and let's remove the `aiidalab-widgets-base` from the `default_apps` list (or the whole `default_apps` line).

3. Start AiiDAlab for `tutorial` profile with

    ```console
    aiidalab-launch start -p tutorial
    ```
4. Follow the instructions on screen to open AiiDAlab in the browser.

See `aiidalab-launch --help` for detailed help.
